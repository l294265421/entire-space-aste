By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !#### #### ####[([42], [41], 'NEG')]

However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .#### #### ####[([38], [52], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], [7], 'NEG')]
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .#### #### ####[([24], [12], 'NEG')]

So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .#### #### ####[([23], [26], 'NEG')]
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .#### #### ####[([10], [7], 'NEG')]

There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .#### #### ####[([3], [44], 'NEG')]

I have eaten at some of the 'best ' sushi joints in NYC ( Nobu , Bond Street , JewelBako , etc ) and Yamato is my favorite .#### #### ####[]
SO GOOD#### #### ####[]
Come on .#### #### ####[]
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .#### #### ####[]
Really , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .#### #### ####[]
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else .#### #### ####[]
This place was reccomended to me by a friend .#### #### ####[]
When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly .#### #### ####[]
Nice for one time special occasion .#### #### ####[]
Went for Mom 's birthday brunch/lunch .#### #### ####[]
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well .#### #### ####[]
Be aware .#### #### ####[]
I come here enjoy very much with husband .#### #### ####[]
Remind me of home .#### #### ####[]
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious#### #### ####[]
It 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .#### #### ####[]
Small , bright , and clean , BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in Astoria and out .#### #### ####[]
The best !#### #### ####[]
Fresh , mind blowing flavors .#### #### ####[]
You want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn ?#### #### ####[]
Skip Nathan 's ... you can get that at the mall ... go to Bark .#### #### ####[]
Delicious , creative and fun .#### #### ####[]
Got a date ? Go here !#### #### ####[]
Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else .#### #### ####[]
It is so romantic .#### #### ####[]
Its dark , and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go .#### #### ####[]
Once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you ca n't stop !#### #### ####[]
You 'll be ther for every anniversary , birthday , valentines day ...#### #### ####[]
For a Fabulous Wedding !#### #### ####[]
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .#### #### ####[]
Ruth , mother of the Bride#### #### ####[]
would NOT go back .#### #### ####[]
$ 170 down the toilet ...#### #### ####[]
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .#### #### ####[]
Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead .#### #### ####[]
Good Experience#### #### ####[]
During our trip to NYC , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pre-theater menu ( offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp ) .#### #### ####[]
over .#### #### ####[]
Will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .#### #### ####[]
Impressed ...#### #### ####[]
Restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .#### #### ####[]
peppers , onions , relish , chilli , cheeses , you NAME it .#### #### ####[]
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !#### #### ####[]
Great find in the West Village !#### #### ####[]
I 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .#### #### ####[]
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .#### #### ####[]
Yes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .#### #### ####[]
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .#### #### ####[]
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm is n't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world , but it 's pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .#### #### ####[]
Unhygienic#### #### ####[]
I do not recommend .#### #### ####[]
I went there 2times .#### #### ####[]
Awesome#### #### ####[]
Inexpensive , unassuming , great time !#### #### ####[]
Try it !#### #### ####[]
Very pleased#### #### ####[]
If you 're into being lost when you 're just five feet from your table then hey , that 's a good thing .#### #### ####[]
Another review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .#### #### ####[]
Still we keep going back : )#### #### ####[]
Rather than eating the meat entree being offered , I requested a vegetarian dish .#### #### ####[]
I was so stunned , and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .#### #### ####[]
I will NEVER return .#### #### ####[]
Best In ALL of NYC#### #### ####[]
I 'm telling you ...#### #### ####[]
you should travel from the Bronx to try it ...#### #### ####[]
so delicious ! ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
My bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie .#### #### ####[]
In about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .#### #### ####[]
Need I say more ?#### #### ####[]
great taste#### #### ####[]
Great , original taste .#### #### ####[]
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .#### #### ####[]
Also , they do not take credit card so come with cash !#### #### ####[]
AMAZING MY FAVORITE ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I have been living in NYC for bit now and I have to say I love to go out and explore the scene .#### #### ####[]
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they do n't make you by bottles .#### #### ####[]
Which lets face it ... .at times it 's a good thing .#### #### ####[]
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME ! ! !#### #### ####[]
One of the best , if not THE best , restaurants in Park Slope ( and NY in general )#### #### ####[]
There is `` Expensive-but-worth-it '' and there is `` Expensive-and-WTF '' ?#### #### ####[]
This is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .#### #### ####[]
Are you freaking kidding me ?#### #### ####[]
Ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .#### #### ####[]
$ 500 included :#### #### ####[]
Drinks : 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $ 35 each .#### #### ####[]
Starters : Kobe Beef Sashimi .#### #### ####[]
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .#### #### ####[]
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe .#### #### ####[]
A beef Consomme .#### #### ####[]
Entrees : Vanison steak and Bison Steak .#### #### ####[]
Just not good at all .#### #### ####[]
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .#### #### ####[]
I was wrong .#### #### ####[]
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .#### #### ####[]
Yes , it is good , but I 've had better for cheaper .#### #### ####[]
Terrible Waste of money.. scammers#### #### ####[]
BUT not in a good way .#### #### ####[]
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .#### #### ####[]
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .#### #### ####[]
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !#### #### ####[]
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .#### #### ####[]
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .#### #### ####[]
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .#### #### ####[]
Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !#### #### ####[]
Since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .#### #### ####[]
Our experience did not ever get any better .#### #### ####[]
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .#### #### ####[]
We asked for beverages and never received them .#### #### ####[]
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !#### #### ####[]
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received !#### #### ####[]
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !#### #### ####[]
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .#### #### ####[]
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !#### #### ####[]
I wish I COULD be refunded !#### #### ####[]
Do n't go with a larger group than 4 !#### #### ####[]
I went here for a family birthday dinner .#### #### ####[]
Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening .#### #### ####[]
The hostess said `` Wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together '' , to which I replied `` no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . ''#### #### ####[]
At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .#### #### ####[]
After we ate our appetizers ( which took all of 8 minutes ) we ordered another round of Brahma 's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .#### #### ####[]
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .#### #### ####[]
We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .#### #### ####[]
She replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . ''#### #### ####[]
We called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .#### #### ####[]
The food arrived in about 15 minutes .#### #### ####[]
They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) .#### #### ####[]
Probably would not go back here .#### #### ####[]
I lived on 50th st , and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out .#### #### ####[]
I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .#### #### ####[]
One of the BEST#### #### ####[]
My GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it .#### #### ####[]
We go often for lunch and the place is packed .#### #### ####[]
Wretched and retching#### #### ####[]
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life .#### #### ####[]
They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant .#### #### ####[]
For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .#### #### ####[]
Fine , I wont hang you for that .#### #### ####[]
Not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .#### #### ####[]
None was made so i hung up .#### #### ####[]
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .#### #### ####[]
Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years , I am now in culinary school , I am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half Korean !#### #### ####[]
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .#### #### ####[]
Eat at your own risk .#### #### ####[]
I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night .#### #### ####[]
More Williamsburg Garbage#### #### ####[]
My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight .#### #### ####[]
We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum .#### #### ####[]
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .#### #### ####[]
I mentioned the squid dish was n't very good when the waitress visited .#### #### ####[]
She just nodded and walked off .#### #### ####[]
There were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect English .#### #### ####[]
As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .#### #### ####[]
We were charged full price .#### #### ####[]
If you ware looking for Korean fusion , I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village .#### #### ####[]
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street , of course .#### #### ####[]
Lives up to the hype#### #### ####[]
We 've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .#### #### ####[]
We 've tried before but it always packed and does n't take reservations .#### #### ####[]
It was well worth the wait .#### #### ####[]
It does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .#### #### ####[]
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .#### #### ####[]
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .#### #### ####[]
Terrible would be a compliment !#### #### ####[]
We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday , we sat in the tent .#### #### ####[]
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !#### #### ####[]
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .#### #### ####[]
Stay away#### #### ####[]
I go here at least once every other week , particularly when it 's cold !#### #### ####[]
I love it .#### #### ####[]
To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu .#### #### ####[]
In fact there is only one I 've tried that even compares ( shabu Tatsu ) and even then I prefer Dokebi .#### #### ####[]
Celebrated my fathers birthday here .#### #### ####[]
We order a bit of everything on the menu .#### #### ####[]
Just want to warn you all - do n't waste your time and money .#### #### ####[]
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .#### #### ####[]
I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary .#### #### ####[]
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation ( if possible )#### #### ####[]
Loved it#### #### ####[]
Maybe it has improved since then ?#### #### ####[]
Dumbfoundingly Poor#### #### ####[]
This was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .#### #### ####[]
Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
Polite acknowledgement is out ;#### #### ####[]
supercilious scorn is in .#### #### ####[]
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?#### #### ####[]
At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .#### #### ####[]
On that scale , it 's a world-beater .#### #### ####[]
I honestly do n't even know where to begin .#### #### ####[]
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .#### #### ####[]
We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .#### #### ####[]
We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .#### #### ####[]
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .#### #### ####[]
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .#### #### ####[]
I 've had better chicken at BBQs ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .#### #### ####[]
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier '' No apology , nothing .#### #### ####[]
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .#### #### ####[]
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .#### #### ####[]
The level of rudeness was preposterous .#### #### ####[]
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .#### #### ####[]
we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes .#### #### ####[]
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .#### #### ####[]
Moving on .#### #### ####[]
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .#### #### ####[]
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .#### #### ####[]
Well ... they can run but they ca n't hide .#### #### ####[]
I live in the West Village and I 've been to a lot of restaurants .#### #### ####[]
Sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive .#### #### ####[]
However , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .#### #### ####[]
I 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( I live on UWS ) .#### #### ####[]
We live nearby BFC .#### #### ####[]
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .#### #### ####[]
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she `` had a BBQ to go to '' that night - WTF ? ?#### #### ####[]
I 'm a friendly person , so I would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .#### #### ####[]
Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee .#### #### ####[]
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...#### #### ####[]
My family ate here last weekend .#### #### ####[]
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .#### #### ####[]
If you go here , do it on his off-night .#### #### ####[]
Everyone must come here at least once .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommend it !#### #### ####[]
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .#### #### ####[]
Appetizers took nearly an hour .#### #### ####[]
When the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .#### #### ####[]
Never got an explanation as to what was going on .#### #### ####[]
When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .#### #### ####[]
On the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .#### #### ####[]
What a hassle !#### #### ####[]
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .#### #### ####[]
Without the wait or attitude , I would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .#### #### ####[]
Expensive#### #### ####[]
I went there after hearing how great it was .#### #### ####[]
Wow .#### #### ####[]
I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far .#### #### ####[]
So rude ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I went with JWILS .#### #### ####[]
Her review is above .#### #### ####[]
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .#### #### ####[]
My friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .#### #### ####[]
What ?#### #### ####[]
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .#### #### ####[]
We did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !#### #### ####[]
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .#### #### ####[]
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .#### #### ####[]
