Although the service could be improved considering the money you put in .#### #### ####[([2], [-1], '-')]
Our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times .#### #### ####[([6], [-1], '-')]
This place rocks ! !#### #### ####[([1], [-1], '-')]
To start off , approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .#### #### ####[([8, 9], [-1], '-')]
On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if I had n't rejected the meal all together .#### #### ####[([9], [-1], '-'), ([2], [-1], '-')]
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue .#### #### ####[([19], [-1], '-')]
To their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .#### #### ####[([13], [-1], '-')]
All considered , I have to say that Ray 's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution .#### #### ####[([8, 10], [-1], '-')]
Yum !#### #### ####[]
Do n't leave the restaurant without it .#### #### ####[]
No Comparison#### #### ####[]
Snotty Attitude#### #### ####[]
– We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast .#### #### ####[]
– We love breakfast food .#### #### ####[]
We never had to wait more than 5 minutes .#### #### ####[]
They are not greasy or anything .#### #### ####[]
Overrated#### #### ####[]
The prices are outrageous , especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood Chinese establishments .#### #### ####[]
I will not go back .#### #### ####[]
– A group of 5 of us went there for Sunday brunch and sat outside .#### #### ####[]
I will never return again .#### #### ####[]
It was absolutely amazing .#### #### ####[]
AMAZING .#### #### ####[]
I can not wait to go back again this coming weekend !#### #### ####[]
Mmm ... good !#### #### ####[]
– Went there last night with a friend .#### #### ####[]
She had heard from a co-worker about this place .#### #### ####[]
We 're going back . : D#### #### ####[]
Some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies ( like me ) so if your not a foodie ( nothing wrong with that ) - head over to McDonalds or some Ruby Tuesday and have at it !#### #### ####[]
If your looking for real quality ( not the BS that is seen on yelp ratings - which allegedly recently got in trouble for `` adjusting '' ratings ) , you need to get in here !#### #### ####[]
Very Disappointing#### #### ####[]
– I took my parents here for their anniversary-very very disappointed ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Nothing really came across as outstanding .#### #### ####[]
Very disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Portions contain less fish than one would expect , particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in NYC ( Masa excluded , of course ) .#### #### ####[]
We were then charged for their most expensive sake ( $ 20+ per serving ) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price .#### #### ####[]
But Im sure this was just an honest mistake ...#### #### ####[]
You are bound to have a very charming time .#### #### ####[]
Not recommanded ! ! !#### #### ####[]
It is not worth going at all and spend your money there ! ! !#### #### ####[]
– Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND downtown .#### #### ####[]
If you 're in the area you should n't be disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Ok ... . – Maybe I went in on someone 's bad day ... .#### #### ####[]
Took forever to get our order taken , water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention .#### #### ####[]
I do n't know if I 'll be back ... .#### #### ####[]
BUt once done , it 's not too much dough , not too much cheese , not too much sauce .#### #### ####[]
Have gone to all the top places .#### #### ####[]
Everything you want and more , very fresh .#### #### ####[]
Its worth the wait , especially since they 'll give you a call when the table is ready .#### #### ####[]
I went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast !#### #### ####[]
Been there lots since and its always a good time .#### #### ####[]
I FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
– Where can I begin .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Just go there and see for yourself .#### #### ####[]
You need to watch your game , they will have it on for you .#### #### ####[]
Kudos to these guys .#### #### ####[]
I found a new home and just moved with a long lease .#### #### ####[]
Thank you#### #### ####[]
Go Beyond the California Rolls ...#### #### ####[]
– We ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a Saturday night .#### #### ####[]
We ordered the marinated grapes , buffalo style chicken wings , and the turkey sandwich .#### #### ####[]
You are likely to be disappointed .#### #### ####[]
I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge ! ( it was a bit expensive )#### #### ####[]
– I 've been to over a dozen Indian places in L.A. , and this is still my favorite .#### #### ####[]
The best thing is , the prices are also quite reasonable .#### #### ####[]
hidden little jem#### #### ####[]
– tucked away over by the Beverly Center .#### #### ####[]
You routinely see Indian families and friends dining there , which is always a good sign .#### #### ####[]
Normally , places ask how hot you want it , but they did n't .#### #### ####[]
I will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches .#### #### ####[]
And they packaged everything nicely so it did n't spill .#### #### ####[]
awesome find#### #### ####[]
– first of all henrymillionare you dont know a thing about middle eastern food so dont talk .#### #### ####[]
Cry me a river , stop complaining you obviously you have no taste in food .#### #### ####[]
and all you other people that have a problem get some help#### #### ####[]
You can order to go if you have to get back to the office too !#### #### ####[]
I had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt .#### #### ####[]
Her sister had the baklava for dessert !#### #### ####[]
What a tastly , flaky treat !#### #### ####[]
There have been several occasions when we 've just not gotten some side dishes we 've ordered .#### #### ####[]
We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food .#### #### ####[]
HOWEVER , one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go ( although with my loud protests ) and were pleasantly surprised .#### #### ####[]
Outside in the area between the restaurant and the park , children were running around while their parents sipped wine .#### #### ####[]
It was like dining at a completely different restaurant .#### #### ####[]
Nice job !#### #### ####[]
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .#### #### ####[]
Untill this happens , my advice is to STAY AWAY .#### #### ####[]
It reminds me of those great little restaurants in San Francisco .#### #### ####[]
Old Reliable#### #### ####[]
– First of all , I am not from Long Beach .#### #### ####[]
I was visiting SoCal a couple of months ago when the friend I was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
( She was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time . )#### #### ####[]
I liked it .#### #### ####[]
It was so much though that I could barely finish but I did , since it was delicious .#### #### ####[]
BTW , I really like Long Beach .#### #### ####[]
It was one of the few places in SoCal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car .#### #### ####[]
WOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
– IT CANT GET ANY BETTER ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
absolutely fabulous ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Two thumbs up !#### #### ####[]
I love sushi , and I have eaten it all over the world .#### #### ####[]
This is right up there with places in Tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned .#### #### ####[]
splendid#### #### ####[]
Perfect on a cold day .#### #### ####[]
$ 6 with tip .#### #### ####[]
Perfection .#### #### ####[]
On weekends , you might have to wait for couple hours .#### #### ####[]
However , they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone .#### #### ####[]
That 's a huge compliment , especially in the fickled restaurant business , ... enough already !#### #### ####[]
I guarantee you wo n't be disappointed , there 's also valet parking .#### #### ####[]
Addicting !#### #### ####[]
I went there with a friend from out of town ... and we were both very impressed !#### #### ####[]
Went on a Monday night , so there was no wait for a table .#### #### ####[]
The price was right too .#### #### ####[]
I 'd go back there in a heartbeat .#### #### ####[]
Should have gone to Trader Joe 's and had frozen pizza : (#### #### ####[]
– My family went on a midweek evening to have dinner .#### #### ####[]
The restaurant was 80 % full and there was a sign posted `` wait to be seated . ''#### #### ####[]
Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal .#### #### ####[]
The prior reviews said Kid friendly ... give me a break with two young children that is light years .#### #### ####[]
The pizza was slightly reminescent of Baker 's Beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago ( a distant second ) .#### #### ####[]
It was decent but nothing exceptional .#### #### ####[]
This establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of Chow Foods group .#### #### ####[]
We used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing .#### #### ####[]
I 'm a born and bred Southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening .#### #### ####[]
Well , I guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to Tutta Bella in Columbia City for some tips .#### #### ####[]
The place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking .#### #### ####[]
WAY OVER-RATED ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
10 !#### #### ####[]
Better than nobu , tomoe , taka , yama , sugiyama , and the rest .#### #### ####[]
Believe it baby !#### #### ####[]
Cut to the chase - this is amazing !#### #### ####[]
It 's unpretentious and underground .#### #### ####[]
It 's fresh , welcoming , delicious , and relaxing .#### #### ####[]
I went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again .#### #### ####[]
What a find !#### #### ####[]
Well worth it#### #### ####[]
Good for late night dining ( last minute planning ) without reservations .#### #### ####[]
I 'm not kidding .#### #### ####[]
Love it every time#### #### ####[]
People complain about the dim lighting , but that is one what I love about this place - if you want to stare at your food in bright light , go to McDonalds .#### #### ####[]
Never had one single problem there .#### #### ####[]
– This was great dining experience .#### #### ####[]
If you 're going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage , do n't miss this one .#### #### ####[]
COMPLETELY OVER RATED !#### #### ####[]
I will have to do more research before checking out new places based on Diners , drive-ins and dives reviews .#### #### ####[]
I noice most reviews mention the bad service .#### #### ####[]
Even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .#### #### ####[]
When the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .#### #### ####[]
It was clear he didn ’ t really care .#### #### ####[]
With so many great breakfast/lunch places in So Cal , this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit .#### #### ####[]
– Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit .#### #### ####[]
I made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online .#### #### ####[]
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left .#### #### ####[]
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .#### #### ####[]
After telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar .#### #### ####[]
As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still does n't work .#### #### ####[]
There are so many better places to visit !#### #### ####[]
Always a winner .#### #### ####[]
She does n't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .#### #### ####[]
But she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying .#### #### ####[]
They have been featured on the food network and they deserve it .#### #### ####[]
Does n't get any better than that .#### #### ####[]
– we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night .#### #### ####[]
there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area .#### #### ####[]
You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .#### #### ####[]
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .#### #### ####[]
we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food .#### #### ####[]
First off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .#### #### ####[]
yummy .#### #### ####[]
next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli .#### #### ####[]
not chewy at all .#### #### ####[]
melt in your mouth .#### #### ####[]
every month if possible .#### #### ####[]
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .#### #### ####[]
We easily spent more than $ 40 per person ( not including alcohol ) and were still hungry .#### #### ####[]
– This past weekend had great weather for San Francisco standards .#### #### ####[]
So for the 'after beach excursion ' , we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to Park Chalet .#### #### ####[]
The restaurant was busy , however there were a few tables open .#### #### ####[]
We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it 'd be a 30 minute wait .#### #### ####[]
So here we are , my wife , 3 year old daughter and I trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building ( where the murals and artifacts are ) .#### #### ####[]
30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off .#### #### ####[]
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !#### #### ####[]
Logic behind that ?#### #### ####[]
None that I can think of .#### #### ####[]
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n't arrive until 45 minutes later ... WITH OUR MAIN COURSE .#### #### ####[]
Um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?#### #### ####[]
Oh I forgot to mention that they do n't have bread service .#### #### ####[]
Its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag .#### #### ####[]
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and I guess that since it was only water , it was n't a priority for them to actually bring it .#### #### ####[]
The upside of the restaurant ?#### #### ####[]
Its great if you spent the day there and did n't want to drive to eat .#### #### ####[]
Parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .#### #### ####[]
I 'd hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like .#### #### ####[]
Always good .#### #### ####[]
– A sushi-fiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner .#### #### ####[]
6pm on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served .#### #### ####[]
As part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;#### #### ####[]
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .#### #### ####[]
When we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .#### #### ####[]
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name .#### #### ####[]
In short , Schooner or Later could n't have cared less about our being at their establishment .#### #### ####[]
Next time we will go somewhere else , or try other restaurants close by like Mimi 's Cafe and Claim Jumper .#### #### ####[]
1 o'clock in the morning .#### #### ####[]
And they give good quantity for the price .#### #### ####[]
This is the case at this gem .#### #### ####[]
You Ca n't Go Wrong Here .#### #### ####[]
– Every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets .#### #### ####[]
Seriously , you ca n't go wrong , if it is unpretentious local fun you seek .#### #### ####[]
We were quickly seated and requested the special dinner , which came with : 1 ) Shellfish and Shrimp appetizer or Caesar Salad , 2 ) 9 oz steak ( with a single potato chip ) , and 3 ) homemade donut holes .#### #### ####[]
Before the steak came , the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested I pick something from the menu .#### #### ####[]
It was steamed and tossed with garlic .#### #### ####[]
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ? MSG ? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant .#### #### ####[]
Finally , the homemade donut holes were served for desert .#### #### ####[]
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not-too-sweet .#### #### ####[]
The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50/pp after tax and tip ( about average ) .#### #### ####[]
Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don ? t look too far out of place .#### #### ####[]
In the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me .#### #### ####[]
VERY GOOD !#### #### ####[]
Overpriced#### #### ####[]
– We dined at the Colorado location today .#### #### ####[]
Waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd .#### #### ####[]
Not sure if I would go back .#### #### ####[]
In fact , many want to return a second time during their visit .#### #### ####[]
They are n't the most talkative , but everytime I 've been there they have been very busy , which probably accounts for the lack of conversation .#### #### ####[]
It 's just the right size for the menu .#### #### ####[]
Excellent#### #### ####[]
You never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there .#### #### ####[]
It ’ s a salad on top of pizza crust .#### #### ####[]
Absolutely delicious .#### #### ####[]
Worth the wait#### #### ####[]
– Had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning , but it was so worth it .#### #### ####[]
Whose writing all the great reviews ?#### #### ####[]
Why is it that ( almost ) every good review is by `` anonymous ? ''#### #### ####[]
DONOT GO !#### #### ####[]
Delicious#### #### ####[]
4 Locations#### #### ####[]
– they have 4 locations .#### #### ####[]
the 2 listed and then one in Southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in Ft Collins .#### #### ####[]
We waited for an hour to be seated .#### #### ####[]
It was worth the wait .#### #### ####[]
Plan on waiting 30-70 minutes .#### #### ####[]
Will definitely be back .#### #### ####[]
Southglenn is largest location .#### #### ####[]
Delicious ... !#### #### ####[]
Delectable#### #### ####[]
Once you 're inside , the real experience begins .#### #### ####[]
I probably would n't go back though 'cuz I do n't know if it 's worth it .#### #### ####[]
Maybe I 'll go back once more many years from now when I 've forgotten I went there already .#### #### ####[]
– Not bad .#### #### ####[]
Should check-up on us more frequently , do n't you think ?#### #### ####[]
– I did n't want to go there because of the reviews and prices I saw on the internet .#### #### ####[]
That was the last night in Vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing - so we walked in the check the place .#### #### ####[]
The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places .#### #### ####[]
There were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink .#### #### ####[]
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .#### #### ####[]
Insultingly Overpriced#### #### ####[]
– This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch : I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service , so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed .#### #### ####[]
The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger .#### #### ####[]
This was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep .#### #### ####[]
Snooze provided an inventive pancake offering , but Le Peep would have provided better service and quality .#### #### ####[]
Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .#### #### ####[]
Given that Ray 's is a seafood restaurant ... well , you get the idea ...#### #### ####[]
