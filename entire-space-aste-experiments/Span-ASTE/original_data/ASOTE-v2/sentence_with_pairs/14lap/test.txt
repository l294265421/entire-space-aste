but in resume this computer rocks !#### #### ####[]
I expected so as it 's an Apple product , but I was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is THE laptop to buy right now .#### #### ####[]
excellent in every way .#### #### ####[]
This mac has been a problem since we got it .#### #### ####[]
Small and still VERY powerful .#### #### ####[]
I had gotten this model for $ 1199.00 on my State 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a MacBook at the local BestBuy !#### #### ####[]
And if you are switching from a pc I hilghy sugest this one .#### #### ####[]
I enjoy having apple products .#### #### ####[]
I will never go back to a PC again !#### #### ####[]
And it 's so quiet that I do n't hear it at all .#### #### ####[]
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .#### #### ####[]
To me it 's a workhorse ... and quiet as can be ... you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to Uncle Sam ... Definite Buy ...#### #### ####[]
I 'm pretty sure when I bought it , my bank account went 'ouch !#### #### ####[]
Thank you so much for the great item .#### #### ####[]
It 's annoying very much and I wo n't ever buy any Acer products .#### #### ####[]
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it would n't have ANY problems .#### #### ####[]
As for the laptop , this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years .#### #### ####[]
It is better than my old acer laptop .#### #### ####[]
I would buy it again in a heartbeat !#### #### ####[]
If someone called me an Apple Fanboy ... it would make sense .#### #### ####[]
A scratch on a $ 1,500 MacBook is unforgivable .#### #### ####[]
I just fell in love with this thing .#### #### ####[]
I have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .#### #### ####[]
This laptop is a great buy .#### #### ####[]
It has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .#### #### ####[]
This device has met my expectations and I 'm sure it will meet yours .#### #### ####[]
Out of all the laptops I have owned , this is by far the best !#### #### ####[]
I can never go back to a PC now , this machine never freezes or has any problems .#### #### ####[]
Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for .#### #### ####[]
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .#### #### ####[]
Great purchase and I definitely did n't miss out on the Black Friday deals .#### #### ####[]
After using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .#### #### ####[]
There has been no problem with anything .#### #### ####[]
I believe with Apple - you get what you pay for .#### #### ####[]
The product is prefect for everyone .#### #### ####[]
I waited to review to make sure it is what it is .#### #### ####[]
I would suggest this product to anyone .#### #### ####[]
With no problems , I 'm happy with this purchase because I saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .#### #### ####[]
I needed something affordable from Apple and was tired of dealing with PC laptop after PC laptop .#### #### ####[]
Just bit the bullet and bought the Mac hoping it will last a lot longer… .#### #### ####[]
This is by far thee best , most reliable computer I could find .#### #### ####[]
Very powerful especially for the money .#### #### ####[]
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .#### #### ####[]
This was a significantly more affordable than getting a new MacBook Pro from Apple .#### #### ####[]
I have always wanted a MacBook Pro ... ..always !#### #### ####[]
Overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !#### #### ####[]
He 's thrilled with his new laptop .#### #### ####[]
Amazing product as you would expect from Apple .#### #### ####[]
Nothing wrong with this computer at all !#### #### ####[]
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur .#### #### ####[]
No hassle and no complaints .#### #### ####[]
LOVE IT I 've always been an apple fan boy , but never had the money to buy a mac , only ipads and iphones , and this is my first mac , blew me away completely .#### #### ####[]
And now I am a proud MacBook owner also !#### #### ####[]
I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .#### #### ####[]
There were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .#### #### ####[]
I 've only had it one day , but I really do love it and I 'm happy it was economical and I 'm finally able to own a Mac !#### #### ####[]
Since I have always used Apple products , the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious .#### #### ####[]
This is my first apple laptop .#### #### ####[]
It makes a great gift .#### #### ####[]
I would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer !#### #### ####[]
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air .#### #### ####[]
The macbook pro is really responsive .#### #### ####[]
it is really expensive though .#### #### ####[]
I will also say it is much better than I expected !#### #### ####[]
This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .#### #### ####[]
And I can attach my projector to it .#### #### ####[]
So , I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try .#### #### ####[]
I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned .#### #### ####[]
BTW , I checked online regarding the old laptop that 'died ' and found that I was not alone , far from it .#### #### ####[]
Seems to me that 's the best way to get Apple 's attention .#### #### ####[]
Very nice so far .#### #### ####[]
You wo n't be disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .#### #### ####[]
This was the same problem with my MacBook ( circa 2007 ) that I just retired .#### #### ####[]
Great things come in small `` packages .#### #### ####[]
HUGE Apple MAC Fan !#### #### ####[]
Looked at HP , ASUS , Acer , Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked .#### #### ####[]
Honestly , I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .#### #### ####[]
Most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .#### #### ####[]
The machine is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .#### #### ####[]
Needless to say , the leap from that to this has been amazing and ( aside from the financial reasons ) I am astounded that I had n't made the switch sooner .#### #### ####[]
Its perfect , not much heavy .#### #### ####[]
I find it not to be very user friendly .#### #### ####[]
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .#### #### ####[]
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !#### #### ####[]
So this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it .#### #### ####[]
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .#### #### ####[]
I was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 344.99 ?#### #### ####[]
SO of course this one came through with the awesomeness !#### #### ####[]
You will not regret buying this computer !#### #### ####[]
Nothing bad to say about it .#### #### ####[]
It s heavy for Mac book but is good .#### #### ####[]
Deal of the year .#### #### ####[]
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .#### #### ####[]
Minis make sense for a lot of people .#### #### ####[]
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow .#### #### ####[]
I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC ( a Sony Vaio ) , but it was basically no better than my old PC , so I returned it .#### #### ####[]
I wanted a simple , reliable laptop .#### #### ####[]
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too !#### #### ####[]
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .#### #### ####[]
Extremely disappointed with the way it is .#### #### ####[]
Never been happier using computer .#### #### ####[]
I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures .#### #### ####[]
Does everything I wanted this laptop to do .#### #### ####[]
Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .#### #### ####[]
Turns out this is a common problem .#### #### ####[]
It is also fast as can be ... you get what you pay for ... well worth the investment#### #### ####[]
But I 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .#### #### ####[]
Overall very impressed , Thank you Apple and Amazon !#### #### ####[]
Very fast for my needs .#### #### ####[]
I bought this Mac in order to replace my old Dell laptop .#### #### ####[]
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement .#### #### ####[]
I finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .#### #### ####[]
So glad I did not waste money on a less than par product .#### #### ####[]
Have n't regretted it one bit .#### #### ####[]
The one thing that Apple does right is computers .#### #### ####[]
I think that they are the best out on the market .#### #### ####[]
That 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .#### #### ####[]
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .#### #### ####[]
My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere .#### #### ####[]
You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .#### #### ####[]
Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC 's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said `` buy a MAC '' .#### #### ####[]
That defeated the whole point of a laptop .#### #### ####[]
But until now , no complains at all .#### #### ####[]
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .#### #### ####[]
Just What I Needed For Portable And My Wallet Too !#### #### ####[]
The device speaks about it self .#### #### ####[]
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one .#### #### ####[]
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk ... .this is in an un-air conditioned room ... ..in air condition it gets slightly warm ... ...#### #### ####[]
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $ 962 : ) .#### #### ####[]
I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time .#### #### ####[]
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini .#### #### ####[]
not something you want to miss out on ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years .#### #### ####[]
Its a pretty decent computer .#### #### ####[]
It was fast , and it was `` different '' .#### #### ####[]
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did .#### #### ####[]
They really screwed the pooch on this one .#### #### ####[]
I finally pulled the trigger and I am blown away by how much more I enjoy my computer tasks using the Mac Mini ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .#### #### ####[]
I am very happy with my first Mac .#### #### ####[]
The machine is speedy and efficient .#### #### ####[]
A *big* upgrade from my 13 '' 2006 macbook .#### #### ####[]
Having a Mac certainly makes life easier .#### #### ####[]
The old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .#### #### ####[]
For this purpose , it 's great .#### #### ####[]
Could n't have asked for more !#### #### ####[]
It certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac 's complain about anything .#### #### ####[]
I do n't have any technical pearls to share .#### #### ####[]
All I can say is I am impressed .#### #### ####[]
It did everything we expected !#### #### ####[]
It 's a nice little gadget .#### #### ####[]
It 's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it .#### #### ####[]
It is the best all around Mac .#### #### ####[]
Also is portable and reliable .#### #### ####[]
It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied .#### #### ####[]
Even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .#### #### ####[]
This was absolutely annoying !#### #### ####[]
But for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the PC 's this is a good foot in the door into mac .#### #### ####[]
and it fits in my briefcase with ease#### #### ####[]
Still not bad for 220.00 .#### #### ####[]
Good computer and fast .#### #### ####[]
Its pretty much fire it up and go .#### #### ####[]
Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .#### #### ####[]
Apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .#### #### ####[]
I went from a Macbook to this Mac Mini and this was a great upgrade !#### #### ####[]
It could n't have been a better decision .#### #### ####[]
It 's great to have a solid Mac in the living room .#### #### ####[]
Very light and easily maneuverable .#### #### ####[]
This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .#### #### ####[]
I am not happy with my purchase#### #### ####[]
However , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .#### #### ####[]
I spent months looking for a good laptop for me and I finally found it !#### #### ####[]
$ 999.00 Tax free .#### #### ####[]
But for now , this laptop is still a workhorse .#### #### ####[]
It 's small but powerful , light but strong , elegant and beautiful ... In resume : it 's a Mac !#### #### ####[]
I wish I would have taken the plunge years ago .#### #### ####[]
I have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .#### #### ####[]
I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time .#### #### ####[]
Its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are GREAT !#### #### ####[]
Does exactly what I bought it 4 .#### #### ####[]
Buy the Mac Mini it 's a terribly great machine .#### #### ####[]
I love this piece of equipment , It will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a MacBook Pro .#### #### ####[]
Very disappointed with Apple .#### #### ####[]
***The review below is no longer relevant , Apple has fixed the issue .#### #### ####[]
It really is very light compared to other computers .#### #### ####[]
This machine is A-mazing .#### #### ####[]
I just hope this expensive laptop does n't go dead like my friends ... it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .#### #### ####[]
Considering another computer should be out of the question#### #### ####[]
Its worth every Penny .#### #### ####[]
This was a great deal for a decked out MacBook Pro .#### #### ####[]
Get this instead , you wo n't be sorry .#### #### ####[]
I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked .#### #### ####[]
It 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models .#### #### ####[]
It was so exciting for me to unwrapp my new mac .#### #### ####[]
so when I had the money to buy one I bought other things instead ... .a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it .#### #### ####[]
See retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop .#### #### ####[]
I 'm no regular customer I hate wasting my time with hellos and how can I help you 's .#### #### ####[]
I have nothing to regret from this new product .#### #### ####[]
Have one myself and Love it !#### #### ####[]
This is especially disheartening when Apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .#### #### ####[]
Stop living in the stone age and buy a mac , you will not be sorry at all ! !#### #### ####[]
Apple hit a home run here .#### #### ####[]
So glad I have gone this route ! !#### #### ####[]
I am so addict to this laptop .#### #### ####[]
Trashed it when I spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .#### #### ####[]
I could n't be more pleased .#### #### ####[]
It is much better than the Acer ultrabook I had before .#### #### ####[]
I finally own a piece of computing equipment that I do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .#### #### ####[]
User friendly , fast and high tech It is amazing !#### #### ####[]
Apple did a great job .#### #### ####[]
It is extremely fast and very compact .#### #### ####[]
You can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia .#### #### ####[]
If you get a lemon ( I have two thirds of my Macs ) , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .#### #### ####[]
Yeah , it 's super expensive .#### #### ####[]
It came before the day it supposed to which is great .#### #### ####[]
It 's a good fix , in my opinion .#### #### ####[]
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition .#### #### ####[]
Before I begin , I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy .#### #### ####[]
its by far faster and more stable then my PC .#### #### ####[]
I purchased a MacBook Pro and this to replace a couple of HP units that I was using .#### #### ####[]
you will not regret it , promise you !#### #### ####[]
Moving from a PC to Mac has never been easier , and I 'm glad that I did it .#### #### ####[]
Have used only Macs for years .#### #### ####[]
Being a tech savvy , APPLE - product loving person , I 'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro !#### #### ####[]
I was always against them but now I buying one I 'll never go back to PC .#### #### ####[]
I think that was a great decision to buy#### #### ####[]
It will make life so much easier next semester , just wish I had it last semester ! !#### #### ####[]
I paid for a new laptop , but was sent a used one .#### #### ####[]
Searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .#### #### ####[]
I bought this one for my 11 year old and the MacBook Air for my 9 year old .#### #### ####[]
I bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !#### #### ####[]
It was at my door in less than 24 hours .#### #### ####[]
It 's also very pricey but you just have to tell yourself it 's an investment and that it 's gon na last you a long time .#### #### ####[]
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer .#### #### ####[]
I love apple but unlike others That does not prevent me to not be honest about how i like it and if its good or not .#### #### ####[]
So , I 'm cooled on Mac buys .#### #### ####[]
It is a great computer for that and I have to say I 'm happy I switched .#### #### ####[]
Overall a nice computer .#### #### ####[]
You can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .#### #### ####[]
Yes , he is a self professed `` Mac snob .#### #### ####[]
It 's the mid 2012 version .#### #### ####[]
I have had many , many issues with PC 's in the past and I 'm finally glad to have joined the Mac revolution !#### #### ####[]
When it broke I wanted another Acer and chose the V5 .#### #### ####[]
Nothing about it that i do n't love , apple always makes a great product .#### #### ####[]
I saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on Amazon and since I have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 3.99 more .#### #### ####[]
It 's all a bit magical .#### #### ####[]
It is BLAZING fast !#### #### ####[]
ive never had a problem with it !#### #### ####[]
I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .#### #### ####[]
Best commuter I have ever owned .#### #### ####[]
What can I say , It 's an Apple .#### #### ####[]
I have an iPhone , and iPad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the Mini .#### #### ####[]
Not super light but still a good one .#### #### ####[]
i had to return it for a replacement .#### #### ####[]
It was wonderful deal for the wonderful product .#### #### ####[]
It completely supports my home business and personal life .#### #### ####[]
I am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents I have received to date .#### #### ####[]
Every day I had this computer , something failed on it .#### #### ####[]
This is the third in a series of MacBooks starting with a Black MacBook .#### #### ####[]
My life has been enriched since I have been using Apple products .#### #### ####[]
i FINALLY DID IT AND THIS MACHINE IS THE WAY TO GO !#### #### ####[]
The few things that are wrong with it are very minor things .#### #### ####[]
It 's a lottery at this point as I have read that other have received new ones with the same problem .#### #### ####[]
This is the first time for me to use a Mac and I 'm really happy with the move .#### #### ####[]
No complaints for an Apple product .#### #### ####[]
The new MacBook is lightyears ahead of my old white plastic MacBook circa 2006 .#### #### ####[]
I would say that 85 % of the design industry is Mac for good reason .#### #### ####[]
The last new mac I bought was in 1998 .#### #### ####[]
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but , I have n't seen them yet .#### #### ####[]
I am very satisfied with the mini .#### #### ####[]
I am going to college next year and I needed a cheaper , quality computer for the goals I am trying to pursue .#### #### ####[]
In the short time of one month since the 2012 Mac Mini was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .#### #### ####[]
If you have to ask you do n't own a Mac and your just not in the know .#### #### ####[]
All my devises “ talk ” to each other .#### #### ####[]
Why not 5 stars ?#### #### ####[]
Very Very Highly Recommended .#### #### ####[]
? I am only interested in the 15.4 McBook Pro Model # MD103LL/A#### #### ####[]
I do n't know why I did n't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it 's expensive .#### #### ####[]
The Macbook Pro is the premier choice for college students .#### #### ####[]
Their products , including the MBP , are beautiful , sleek and clever .#### #### ####[]
Perfect -- thanks so .#### #### ####[]
Also , it hardly ever crashes .#### #### ####[]
I was so excited to get this in the mail i nearly gave myself a heart attack .#### #### ####[]
When i finally held it in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .#### #### ####[]
This computer is not cheap and represent an achievement for me .#### #### ####[]
GET THIS MACHINE#### #### ####[]
It 's shiny and it 's pretty .#### #### ####[]
All the above aside this machine ROCKS !#### #### ####[]
Bottom line , if you can afford it , get a Mac !#### #### ####[]
I finally made the leap after my Gateway crapped out on me .#### #### ####[]
Who makes a laptop that ca n't rest on your lap ?#### #### ####[]
wow the new macbook pro hanged as i tried to type this review .#### #### ####[]
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .#### #### ####[]
I hope this review helps .#### #### ####[]
However , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .#### #### ####[]
Far superior to my MacBook .#### #### ####[]
It was quite easy .#### #### ####[]
I decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for Xmas .#### #### ####[]
This is no exception .#### #### ####[]
I have had a black macbook since 2007 .#### #### ####[]
If that is the case , then I am completely happy#### #### ####[]
10/10 five stars would recommend .#### #### ####[]
I fell in love with my machine , and it was pampered .#### #### ####[]
It is the best laptop ever ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Was skeptical about buying an electronic item online but it turned out to be a positive experience .#### #### ####[]
Not a scratch or mark on it .#### #### ####[]
Words can not express how much I love my new Mac .#### #### ####[]
The item received was exactly as identified .#### #### ####[]
Its everything mac offers .#### #### ####[]
Besides being elegant , the MacBooks are durable .#### #### ####[]
Yes , the MBP is more expensive than competing PC laptops .#### #### ####[]
They replaced it and so far so good .#### #### ####[]
Good in every aspect .#### #### ####[]
Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen , its a great computer .#### #### ####[]
Just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .#### #### ####[]
Really great ... Well let me start at the beginning .#### #### ####[]
This was a gift for my grand son .#### #### ####[]
Then only FOUR months later , my great MacBook pro FAILED .#### #### ####[]
Seems a much more economical way to get into Apple than their other computers .#### #### ####[]
I 'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product .#### #### ####[]
All you get is a box and a computer .#### #### ####[]
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .#### #### ####[]
My bag just got a little lighter .#### #### ####[]
I 'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfect..i It is ! !#### #### ####[]
This machine is flawless , fast , and classy .#### #### ####[]
I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro .#### #### ####[]
This laptop is a 100 times better than a Chromebook !#### #### ####[]
At $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .#### #### ####[]
I might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?#### #### ####[]
The ultimate graduation gift .#### #### ####[]
was debating to buy one for months , checked out different stuff on youtube , and read different articles and debates , I just didnt really wan na spend the money but Im glad that I did .#### #### ####[]
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC 's require .#### #### ####[]
I am an Info Sys major in college , so I started researching this issue on my own .#### #### ####[]
Solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .#### #### ####[]
Still have n't solved this .#### #### ####[]
It is EXTREMELY fast and never lags .#### #### ####[]
I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues .#### #### ####[]
Hopefully my replacement is brand new .#### #### ####[]
Actually , I think I was intimidated by the change from a PC .#### #### ####[]
Definitely worth spending the money on it .#### #### ####[]
I have three words : Piece of Junk !#### #### ####[]
Fits all my personal needs .#### #### ####[]
I 'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes .#### #### ####[]
I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about .#### #### ####[]
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13.3 MacBook Pro Model # MD101LL/A .#### #### ####[]
I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed .#### #### ####[]
A great college tool !#### #### ####[]
I called apple and no solution .#### #### ####[]
The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up .#### #### ####[]
I am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .#### #### ####[]
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH . [ ...#### #### ####[]
Quietest laptop I have ever owned .#### #### ####[]
again this is just my personal honest opinion .#### #### ####[]
If you have much higher expectations than that ... I would look elsewhere .#### #### ####[]
I 'm going to buy a logitevh c270 .#### #### ####[]
Very happy with my purchase .#### #### ####[]
I 'M SO HAPPY WITH MY macbook pro !#### #### ####[]
It is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .#### #### ####[]
I love everything about this computer .#### #### ####[]
I found it toughest to decide between Dell ultra books and Apple .#### #### ####[]
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness !#### #### ####[]
I do n't want to RUN a computer ; I want to USE a computer .#### #### ####[]
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back .#### #### ####[]
I do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this MacBook Pro Laptop ( You get what you pay for ) .#### #### ####[]
I 've almost have bought every generation of MacMinis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .#### #### ####[]
I had to return it because it would n't even start .#### #### ####[]
Great deal on an amazing lap top !#### #### ####[]
Best money I ever spent .#### #### ####[]
But I did n't want to spend another thousand on a laptop since my work already provides me with a PC .#### #### ####[]
can never go wrong with apple products .#### #### ####[]
It doesnt get hot like my PC , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it .#### #### ####[]
I have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but I love it already .#### #### ####[]
Ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .#### #### ####[]
This flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else Apple got right with the Mini .#### #### ####[]
Added an iMac about 2 years later .#### #### ####[]
I will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends#### #### ####[]
I 'm done with WinDoze computers .#### #### ####[]
