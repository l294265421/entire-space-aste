We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !#### #### ####[([18], [20], 'POS')]

For those of you who do n't know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . )#### #### ####[]
And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !#### #### ####[]
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .#### #### ####[]
You can do it here .#### #### ####[]
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .#### #### ####[]
I would highly recommend .#### #### ####[]
One of my favorite places in Manhattan .#### #### ####[]
I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .#### #### ####[]
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .#### #### ####[]
How do you rate home ?#### #### ####[]
I do n't think I would go again .#### #### ####[]
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .#### #### ####[]
it helps if you know what to order .#### #### ####[]
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .#### #### ####[]
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .#### #### ####[]
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .#### #### ####[]
Frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .#### #### ####[]
Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .#### #### ####[]
As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .#### #### ####[]
Everything we had was good or ok ... .but definitely nothing great .#### #### ####[]
What 's the difference between the two ?#### #### ####[]
The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .#### #### ####[]
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .#### #### ####[]
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .#### #### ####[]
Ciao Bella#### #### ####[]
Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .#### #### ####[]
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .#### #### ####[]
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .#### #### ####[]
Have the iced tea .#### #### ####[]
wont come back again for sure !#### #### ####[]
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
I loved it and would go again .#### #### ####[]
All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .#### #### ####[]
What more can you ask for ?#### #### ####[]
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .#### #### ####[]
But $ 1 for each small piece ? ? ?#### #### ####[]
The prices are wonderfully low .#### #### ####[]
A guaranteeed delight !#### #### ####[]
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .#### #### ####[]
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .#### #### ####[]
To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .#### #### ####[]
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .#### #### ####[]
Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !#### #### ####[]
I do n't get it either .#### #### ####[]
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )#### #### ####[]
highly recommended .#### #### ####[]
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .#### #### ####[]
Go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ...#### #### ####[]
You will find yourself returning quite often .#### #### ####[]
And amazingly cheap .#### #### ####[]
We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .#### #### ####[]
Unbelievable .#### #### ####[]
Never fails to please .#### #### ####[]
It 's also attached to Angel 's Share , which is a cool , more romantic bar ...#### #### ####[]
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .#### #### ####[]
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies .#### #### ####[]
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .#### #### ####[]
Quite simply it 's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .#### #### ####[]
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .#### #### ####[]
It 's popular w/the late crowd .#### #### ####[]
We were then shooed inside .#### #### ####[]
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently#### #### ####[]
And I hate to say this but I doubt I 'll ever go back .#### #### ####[]
Nice value .#### #### ####[]
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular .#### #### ####[]
We had a good time .#### #### ####[]
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .#### #### ####[]
Priced at upper intermediate range .#### #### ####[]
We were less than impressed .#### #### ####[]
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
Why ?#### #### ####[]
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .#### #### ####[]
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .#### #### ####[]
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .#### #### ####[]
I had my eyes on this place , promising myself I will one day 'give it a try . '#### #### ####[]
Even my Indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .#### #### ####[]
I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .#### #### ####[]
I am going to the mid town location next .#### #### ####[]
A little noise but I think that was because of our party !#### #### ####[]
We got most of it back at home with us .#### #### ####[]
And it was quick which is very important .#### #### ####[]
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .#### #### ####[]
enough said !#### #### ####[]
It was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-I 've had better for less elsewhere !#### #### ####[]
Over 100 different choices to create your own .#### #### ####[]
Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .#### #### ####[]
Then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .#### #### ####[]
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !#### #### ####[]
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .#### #### ####[]
Will not be back .#### #### ####[]
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .#### #### ####[]
Having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot .#### #### ####[]
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .#### #### ####[]
Very cozy and warm inside ... ..#### #### ####[]
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .#### #### ####[]
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .#### #### ####[]
For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .#### #### ####[]
Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .#### #### ####[]
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .#### #### ####[]
I love it .#### #### ####[]
A classic !#### #### ####[]
I highly recommend it .#### #### ####[]
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .#### #### ####[]
Was there Friday night .#### #### ####[]
Molto bene !#### #### ####[]
It is thick and slightly soggy .#### #### ####[]
Moderate prices .#### #### ####[]
A real dissapointment .#### #### ####[]
I 'll keep this short .#### #### ####[]
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : Cassuolet , Steake Fritte , Tripe Stew , etc ; simple stuff .#### #### ####[]
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .#### #### ####[]
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .#### #### ####[]
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...#### #### ####[]
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .#### #### ####[]
This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .#### #### ####[]
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?#### #### ####[]
( i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood.. )#### #### ####[]
Went there for an office lunch .#### #### ####[]
This was a great surprise .#### #### ####[]
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .#### #### ####[]
I wish they would change back to what it was before .#### #### ####[]
I had a great experience .#### #### ####[]
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .#### #### ####[]
Not worth it .#### #### ####[]
I know because I live nearby .#### #### ####[]
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .#### #### ####[]
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .#### #### ####[]
No plans to return anytime soon .#### #### ####[]
Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't wait to go back .#### #### ####[]
I have been twice to this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .#### #### ####[]
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .#### #### ####[]
Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .#### #### ####[]
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .#### #### ####[]
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience ! )#### #### ####[]
When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's .#### #### ####[]
but overall i give it a 10#### #### ####[]
Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .#### #### ####[]
I go twice a month !#### #### ####[]
It is simply amazing .#### #### ####[]
Too bad Latin Quarters closed .#### #### ####[]
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .#### #### ####[]
It was wonderful .#### #### ####[]
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner :#### #### ####[]
Our friends have not arrived yet .#### #### ####[]
For those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n't get it .#### #### ####[]
Amazing !#### #### ####[]
Good luck getting a table .#### #### ####[]
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .#### #### ####[]
( that is A MUST , but not every restaurant can do ... )#### #### ####[]
Even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in New York pizza restaurants ) .#### #### ####[]
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .#### #### ####[]
A must try !#### #### ####[]
Will absolutely visit again .#### #### ####[]
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .#### #### ####[]
It 's to die for !#### #### ####[]
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?#### #### ####[]
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave .#### #### ####[]
I 've never ordered anything else from their menu ... there 's no need to .#### #### ####[]
MMmmm ... it was delicious .#### #### ####[]
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .#### #### ####[]
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . (#### #### ####[]
We were very pleasantly surprised .#### #### ####[]
We were very disappointed .#### #### ####[]
It was pretty inexpensive too .#### #### ####[]
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !#### #### ####[]
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .#### #### ####[]
esp . during happy hour !#### #### ####[]
too large for just two people but nothing was left .#### #### ####[]
Wonderful at holiday time .#### #### ####[]
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .#### #### ####[]
Me and my girls will definitely go back .#### #### ####[]
LOL#### #### ####[]
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .#### #### ####[]
Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .#### #### ####[]
Definately check it out ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .#### #### ####[]
A big disappointment , all around .#### #### ####[]
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .#### #### ####[]
I would go back .#### #### ####[]
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .#### #### ####[]
I grew up on these bagels .#### #### ####[]
I recommend it !#### #### ####[]
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .#### #### ####[]
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .#### #### ####[]
I went there with my friend last saturday .#### #### ####[]
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .#### #### ####[]
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .#### #### ####[]
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .#### #### ####[]
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .#### #### ####[]
I plan on stopping by next week as well .#### #### ####[]
I have been going back again and again .#### #### ####[]
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommended .#### #### ####[]
Jimmy is Dominican !#### #### ####[]
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .#### #### ####[]
Good for dates or with friends .#### #### ####[]
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i 'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .#### #### ####[]
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .#### #### ####[]
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A .#### #### ####[]
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .#### #### ####[]
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho .#### #### ####[]
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .#### #### ####[]
We 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .#### #### ####[]
The price very reasonable .#### #### ####[]
Such a disappointment ...#### #### ####[]
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !#### #### ####[]
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .#### #### ####[]
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .#### #### ####[]
I 've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .#### #### ####[]
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .#### #### ####[]
it 's delicious !#### #### ####[]
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .#### #### ####[]
We all felt it was worth it .#### #### ####[]
I just do n't understand all the hype ...#### #### ####[]
Definitely a neighborhood favorite .#### #### ####[]
We left , never to return .#### #### ####[]
So eat fast and order a lot .#### #### ####[]
When you add it all together , it just does n't seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices .#### #### ####[]
We went to Ino for Valentines .#### #### ####[]
I have n't been to the other locations .#### #### ####[]
That place was awesome , , , sally !#### #### ####[]
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .#### #### ####[]
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !#### #### ####[]
i would just ask for no oil next time .#### #### ####[]
Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of bagels .#### #### ####[]
If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .#### #### ####[]
Would n't recomend it for dinner !#### #### ####[]
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .#### #### ####[]
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .#### #### ####[]
It was divine melts in your mouth .#### #### ####[]
( Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .#### #### ####[]
Its located in greenewich village .#### #### ####[]
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30 .#### #### ####[]
I came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since .#### #### ####[]
You 'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .#### #### ####[]
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience .#### #### ####[]
Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater .#### #### ####[]
Probably would not go again ...#### #### ####[]
Will never be back .#### #### ####[]
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .#### #### ####[]
You ca n't go wrong here .#### #### ####[]
But too far east !#### #### ####[]
I was there on sat . for my birthday and we had an excellent time .#### #### ####[]
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best .#### #### ####[]
It 's very spicy but not offensive .#### #### ####[]
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .#### #### ####[]
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .#### #### ####[]
Went to Village last night for my birthday .#### #### ####[]
I 've eaten at many different Indian restaurants .#### #### ####[]
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G . again last night .#### #### ####[]
There are other people waiting !#### #### ####[]
Was surprisingly disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Overall , not worth the money .#### #### ####[]
It 's cuz it 's so good you need to taste it ! ! !#### #### ####[]
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .#### #### ####[]
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .#### #### ####[]
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .#### #### ####[]
If only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !#### #### ####[]
this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend .#### #### ####[]
They charge different prices all the time .#### #### ####[]
No , really .#### #### ####[]
As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .#### #### ####[]
Cute and decorative .#### #### ####[]
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .#### #### ####[]
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .#### #### ####[]
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .#### #### ####[]
Ahhh ...#### #### ####[]
When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .#### #### ####[]
Okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .#### #### ####[]
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .#### #### ####[]
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .#### #### ####[]
Our teenage kids love it , too .#### #### ####[]
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave .#### #### ####[]
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .#### #### ####[]
It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .#### #### ####[]
P.S . Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .#### #### ####[]
DO not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .#### #### ####[]
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .#### #### ####[]
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .#### #### ####[]
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .#### #### ####[]
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .#### #### ####[]
I definitely would n't go back .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommended to all !#### #### ####[]
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .#### #### ####[]
Prices are in line .#### #### ####[]
Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .#### #### ####[]
Just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .#### #### ####[]
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .#### #### ####[]
It just was n't Thai .#### #### ####[]
I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .#### #### ####[]
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here .#### #### ####[]
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .#### #### ####[]
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .#### #### ####[]
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .#### #### ####[]
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .#### #### ####[]
We 'd go back again#### #### ####[]
I 'm saving up for my next visit .#### #### ####[]
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .#### #### ####[]
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !#### #### ####[]
Would NEVER go back there .#### #### ####[]
I will be going back very soon .#### #### ####[]
I sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes .#### #### ####[]
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .#### #### ####[]
Give it a try and enjoy .#### #### ####[]
I 've been here twice now .#### #### ####[]
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .#### #### ####[]
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .#### #### ####[]
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !#### #### ####[]
I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently .#### #### ####[]
Recommendations , of course , are required !#### #### ####[]
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .#### #### ####[]
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .#### #### ####[]
From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .#### #### ####[]
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .#### #### ####[]
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .#### #### ####[]
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .#### #### ####[]
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had ( except for my mom 's of course ) .#### #### ####[]
Do n't waste money on decor .#### #### ####[]
We will go back every time we are in the City .#### #### ####[]
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .#### #### ####[]
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .#### #### ####[]
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .#### #### ####[]
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !#### #### ####[]
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .#### #### ####[]
Much more reasonably priced too !#### #### ####[]
Prices are very good .#### #### ####[]
My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .#### #### ####[]
keep up the good work .#### #### ####[]
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .#### #### ####[]
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .#### #### ####[]
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .#### #### ####[]
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly .#### #### ####[]
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .#### #### ####[]
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .#### #### ####[]
Always busy but fast moving .#### #### ####[]
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently .#### #### ####[]
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .#### #### ####[]
It is expensive but well worth the money .#### #### ####[]
Once for dinner and once for brunch .#### #### ####[]
Never again !#### #### ####[]
Ca n't wait to go back .#### #### ####[]
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Fantastic !#### #### ####[]
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .#### #### ####[]
( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal .#### #### ####[]
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .#### #### ####[]
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .#### #### ####[]
Just ignore the trendy wannabes .#### #### ####[]
I will be going back and heartily recommend it !#### #### ####[]
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .#### #### ####[]
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .#### #### ####[]
The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also .#### #### ####[]
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .#### #### ####[]
We were n't !#### #### ####[]
Keep up the good work guys !#### #### ####[]
But they do .#### #### ####[]
If you want to dine with large party , I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT .#### #### ####[]
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .#### #### ####[]
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .#### #### ####[]
Of course , it is crowded but who cares .#### #### ####[]
We all ordered different entrees so we could share .#### #### ####[]
JUST AWSOME .#### #### ####[]
I will definetly be going back .#### #### ####[]
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !#### #### ####[]
Old school meets New world .#### #### ####[]
But , they were too big for the bun .#### #### ####[]
I look forward to eating here again#### #### ####[]
My six year old loved it .#### #### ####[]
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .#### #### ####[]
I have eaten a lot of pizza here .#### #### ####[]
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .#### #### ####[]
Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave .#### #### ####[]
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .#### #### ####[]
Hurley 's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came .#### #### ####[]
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .#### #### ####[]
Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .#### #### ####[]
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .#### #### ####[]
it is not consistent .#### #### ####[]
This restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !#### #### ####[]
