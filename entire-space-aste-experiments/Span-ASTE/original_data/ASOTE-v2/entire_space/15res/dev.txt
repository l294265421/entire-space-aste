We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .#### #### ####[]
They all know you .#### #### ####[]
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .#### #### ####[]
Located at the end of a magnificent block .#### #### ####[]
And I 've been to many NYC delis .#### #### ####[]
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy 's !#### #### ####[]
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .#### #### ####[]
Went to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night .#### #### ####[]
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .#### #### ####[]
Worth the trip from Manhattan .#### #### ####[]
I will be back !#### #### ####[]
Hey , I think $ 2+ for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .#### #### ####[]
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .#### #### ####[]
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard#### #### ####[]
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .#### #### ####[]
Go here .#### #### ####[]
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )#### #### ####[]
