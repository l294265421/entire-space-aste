I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .#### #### ####[([16], [2], 'POS')]

Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac !#### #### ####[([12], [4], 'POS'), ([14], [4], 'POS')]

Honestly , I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for !#### #### ####[]
So far , so good !#### #### ####[]
I love the 15 '' MacBook Pro .#### #### ####[]
I 've saved a lot of time and headaches so far , using my new MacBook Pro .#### #### ####[]
Both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .#### #### ####[]
So if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .#### #### ####[]
I 've tried going back to XL but there still problems .#### #### ####[]
Then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .#### #### ####[]
-got it back 3 months later#### #### ####[]
Since I never really got to use this , I ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them .#### #### ####[]
I was waiting for this model to be released since January , and have been holding off on buying a Macbook Pro until the new model came out .#### #### ####[]
Stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then I found it can only be loaded with 2GB *maximum* .#### #### ####[]
, which Apple does n't offer , is why I bought my MacBook at Best Buy .#### #### ####[]
I 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .#### #### ####[]
Please , anyone who is considering getting this computer , stop .#### #### ####[]
It is everything that I would want in a computer .#### #### ####[]
This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone .#### #### ####[]
I will NEVER buy ( Refurbished ) again , I do n't cae how cheap it is .#### #### ####[]
Buy this .#### #### ####[]
I love everything about it .#### #### ####[]
It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier .#### #### ####[]
Just what the doctor ordered .#### #### ####[]
This has happened three times so far .#### #### ####[]
It was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .#### #### ####[]
Stay away from HP .#### #### ####[]
At first when I got this product , I loved it .#### #### ####[]
This unit is not .#### #### ####[]
Two , owning a 17 in.mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .#### #### ####[]
Needless to say , not to happy with the product .#### #### ####[]
I worked in IT retail sales before .#### #### ####[]
After 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and Acer is indifferent to the issue .#### #### ####[]
This thing is a lemon .#### #### ####[]
Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell .#### #### ####[]
My next laptop will also be a Mac !#### #### ####[]
I 've had the MacBook Pro 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great computer .#### #### ####[]
Congratulations Asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop .#### #### ####[]
another problem .#### #### ####[]
For example , when my husband turns the light out while I 'm on the computer .#### #### ####[]
It was weird .#### #### ####[]
If you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .#### #### ####[]
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .#### #### ####[]
You will regret it if you buy any dell .#### #### ####[]
English must have been his third or fourth language .#### #### ####[]
BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART , I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM .#### #### ####[]
But , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .#### #### ####[]
Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine .#### #### ####[]
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .#### #### ####[]
This is not Best Buy 's fault .#### #### ####[]
To my mind much more usable than the toy called an IPad .#### #### ####[]
do not buy you will be disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .#### #### ####[]
*5 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer .#### #### ####[]
I WANT MY L505-s5988 BACK !#### #### ####[]
I previously owned a Toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years .#### #### ####[]
I had to have these computers in my school .#### #### ####[]
I homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .#### #### ####[]
it was shooting sparks !#### #### ####[]
I have never had it crash , randomly turn off ,#### #### ####[]
It was always getting froze up .#### #### ####[]
Right out of the box , this little netbook did everything I asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites ( my biggest complaint previously ) .#### #### ####[]
I do not know for sure .#### #### ####[]
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT .#### #### ####[]
Still trying to learn how to use it .#### #### ####[]
IT IS TRASH !#### #### ####[]
I wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop .#### #### ####[]
breaks easily .#### #### ####[]
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I wo n't have to worry about a crash .#### #### ####[]
I got what I paid for .#### #### ####[]
-Stay away from Apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .#### #### ####[]
Enjoy your sitdown#### #### ####[]
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop .#### #### ####[]
I never have had a good result with this computer .#### #### ####[]
I am now making a point to avoid their products and I hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well .#### #### ####[]
I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one .#### #### ####[]
Taking it anywhere was a pain !#### #### ####[]
All the problems I have had with PC 's are solved with a Mac : the issue of overheating-my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .#### #### ####[]
Toshiba is a great brand , even though I have n't had it for a long time , I am very happy with it !#### #### ####[]
I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !#### #### ####[]
IT WANT TAKE IT , IT KEEP SAYING ERROR .#### #### ####[]
I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it .#### #### ####[]
my information was all lost ( my fault , I know , but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac , the paragon of all computers !#### #### ####[]
I will only buy apple laptops from now on .#### #### ####[]
I should have sent it back to them then .#### #### ####[]
I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused .#### #### ####[]
It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was .#### #### ####[]
Stay away from Envy .#### #### ####[]
It 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .#### #### ####[]
It will be returned in the state to which it was shipped Michigan .#### #### ####[]
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it .#### #### ####[]
It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .#### #### ####[]
I have owned it only two months !#### #### ####[]
This little netboook is helping me get work done !#### #### ####[]
Did n't expect to repair it at once !#### #### ####[]
To those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !#### #### ####[]
Needless to say a PC that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !#### #### ####[]
To this day , there are NONE .#### #### ####[]
I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I 've ever bought .#### #### ####[]
My smart phone is faster !#### #### ####[]
I have not have any problems .#### #### ####[]
I am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .#### #### ####[]
Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me .#### #### ####[]
The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .#### #### ####[]
He came into my house , fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .#### #### ####[]
at first !#### #### ####[]
The problems started with just the screen freezing .#### #### ####[]
I tried out another Mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine .#### #### ####[]
It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .#### #### ####[]
They were great in handling this problem , and I 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .#### #### ####[]
I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market .#### #### ####[]
I love the Apple products .#### #### ####[]
-I give up on my data , I just want a computer reasonably fast ...#### #### ####[]
I am a college student and it has been very useful .#### #### ####[]
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .#### #### ####[]
I think this computer is super lame .#### #### ####[]
I also own an HP notebook and it does n't even come close .#### #### ####[]
If I have a few hundred dollars to spare , I 'd buy the Pro line though , the 2.53 and 2.66 GHz model .#### #### ####[]
I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .#### #### ####[]
Good luck .#### #### ####[]
I have loved this since i took it out of the box .#### #### ####[]
I will never purchase a HP again ever .#### #### ####[]
This computer was awful , I would never recomend it to another person .#### #### ####[]
I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it , I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use .#### #### ####[]
Enough said .#### #### ####[]
If so , you may be having similar problems .#### #### ####[]
Would do business again .#### #### ####[]
It is a bit heavy .#### #### ####[]
It is sleek , smooth , and lightweight .#### #### ####[]
I just love this lap top , I just wish it were all silver or they had all black .#### #### ####[]
ASUS said my net-book was working properly .#### #### ####[]
Plus stylish .#### #### ####[]
Thanks , MacConnection , for making this a seamless purchase !#### #### ####[]
It freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it .#### #### ####[]
I 'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC .#### #### ####[]
My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC .#### #### ####[]
This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .#### #### ####[]
-They reported that the computer is in their headquarters .#### #### ####[]
If you have the money I suggest going for the i7 .#### #### ####[]
The difference is phenomenal .#### #### ####[]
I did not like my acer .#### #### ####[]
Not super fancy , but not super expensive either .#### #### ####[]
believe me apple has a reputation .#### #### ####[]
So glad I decided to upgrade !#### #### ####[]
This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and I have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .#### #### ####[]
I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it !#### #### ####[]
A lot of help they WERE N'T !#### #### ####[]
Will not buy another Toshiba , this is my second , not happy w/ either .#### #### ####[]
So I got another netbook which I love !#### #### ####[]
Took the netbook on a vacation trip and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop .#### #### ####[]
Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on .#### #### ####[]
After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route .#### #### ####[]
While many people brag about Mac being `` intuitive '' , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a PC , but once I got the hang of it , I do n't want to go back .#### #### ####[]
Who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? So , I said I wanted a new set .#### #### ####[]
There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all .#### #### ####[]
If you buy , pray you dont have major prolems .#### #### ####[]
Avoid this model .#### #### ####[]
Good luck with your purchase options .#### #### ####[]
I like the laptop overall .#### #### ####[]
At least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .#### #### ####[]
Although my model was listed as recalled , HP denied my claim .#### #### ####[]
It may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .#### #### ####[]
I left the place angrily .#### #### ####[]
I could n't afford a new mac , so I bought a PC instead .#### #### ####[]
Obviously we both got new Macs .#### #### ####[]
I burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so I can place it there .#### #### ####[]
Everything else just install and go .#### #### ####[]
This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised .#### #### ####[]
He did n't work for sony , he was just approved to fix their crappy products .#### #### ####[]
( You may be reading one now !#### #### ####[]
The latest is on my LG Netbook X12#### #### ####[]
You will not regret buying such a great thing like this !#### #### ####[]
I can do everything I could before , only faster and more efficiently .#### #### ####[]
I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one .#### #### ####[]
I brought this laptop last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .#### #### ####[]
If it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a Friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .#### #### ####[]
I 'm hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .#### #### ####[]
Just a bunch of idiots who 's English as a 5th language is forced at best .#### #### ####[]
If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC 's .#### #### ####[]
Im very happy with this computer !#### #### ####[]
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas .#### #### ####[]
I should have been more observant .#### #### ####[]
So this review might be a tad bit bias .#### #### ####[]
it was a tough choice .#### #### ####[]
Maybe it 's Acer , maybe it 's MSFT .#### #### ####[]
But in fact it is totally the opposite .#### #### ####[]
I am taking back today .#### #### ####[]
i cant believe HP put this out .#### #### ####[]
Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .#### #### ####[]
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .#### #### ####[]
It was returned on the third day I owned it .#### #### ####[]
Still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .#### #### ####[]
It 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb .#### #### ####[]
Love it so far .#### #### ####[]
I am very happy with this laptop .#### #### ####[]
Some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains .#### #### ####[]
What 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time I submitted it in case it does n't keep what I put here are my aratings#### #### ####[]
It 's the inside that is truly wonderful .#### #### ####[]
I 've had this laptop for about a month now .#### #### ####[]
return it .#### #### ####[]
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned .#### #### ####[]
It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .#### #### ####[]
At first it 's like you 're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop .#### #### ####[]
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .#### #### ####[]
This is my second MacBook .#### #### ####[]
I called back to ensure that received it , they had .#### #### ####[]
Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .#### #### ####[]
My kids have to take their PCs in once a year to have them `` de-bugged '' .#### #### ####[]
Seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the Dell#### #### ####[]
I have used a couple of others on the job as well .#### #### ####[]
The Macbook is a fantastic laptop .#### #### ####[]
We now own two of these , identical .#### #### ####[]
You just lose a customer .#### #### ####[]
Well , I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC , but took the Apple to the conference .#### #### ####[]
was a great deal i will give that .#### #### ####[]
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice .#### #### ####[]
You better believe my next computer will be a MAC !#### #### ####[]
Best Buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .#### #### ####[]
One , owning a mac is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of a mac book a portable version ) .#### #### ####[]
The laptop is gorgeous .#### #### ####[]
It seems to be incompatible with everything else .#### #### ####[]
I purchased this laptop 9 months ago !#### #### ####[]
It still serves me well both in business and home needs .#### #### ####[]
I can throw anything at it ( and I do ) , Pictures , video editing , schoolwork .#### #### ####[]
My son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind , and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school .#### #### ####[]
So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .#### #### ####[]
First of all , I 've been Dell fan for more than fifteen years .#### #### ####[]
I am definitely sold , and not going back to PCs for home use !#### #### ####[]
Now I could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !#### #### ####[]
I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .#### #### ####[]
It ca n't get any better .#### #### ####[]
I went right out and purchased another laptop .#### #### ####[]
I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents .#### #### ####[]
I bought my first MacBook after seeing the product demonstrated .#### #### ####[]
I do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .#### #### ####[]
it 's just a great toy to have around .#### #### ####[]
-Apparently , contactus @ euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints .#### #### ####[]
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .#### #### ####[]
2 ) Blue screen first month#### #### ####[]
The perfect notebook ...#### #### ####[]
Winters is on it 's way and I imagine it will be cozy .#### #### ####[]
Dell sucks#### #### ####[]
I am totally satisfied with my little toshie !#### #### ####[]
Kind of annoying , but I still love the laptop .#### #### ####[]
It has worked fine .#### #### ####[]
Could n't keep a page up you were working on !#### #### ####[]
this is one of the reasons I purchased it .#### #### ####[]
So far , a great product .#### #### ####[]
After doing CAD work all day at work , using a higher end PC , I could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .#### #### ####[]
It 's A MAC ! !#### #### ####[]
So far so good with this laptop .#### #### ####[]
After looking at all the pros and cons , I decided on the Macbook Pro .#### #### ####[]
The Macbooks worth every penny .#### #### ####[]
That seemed to solve the problem , till I wrote an article with semicolons in it .#### #### ####[]
I am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .#### #### ####[]
They 're easy , fun , powerful and will last a long time .#### #### ####[]
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .#### #### ####[]
One of the smartest thing I did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .#### #### ####[]
We decided we would try to trade-in our old ones .#### #### ####[]
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .#### #### ####[]
That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought .#### #### ####[]
Pretty disappointed about this product .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't honestly say I was heartbroken .#### #### ####[]
Took a while to clean it up to my specs .#### #### ####[]
Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought .#### #### ####[]
Acer wo n't replace the laptop .#### #### ####[]
I took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the `` blue screen of death '' .#### #### ####[]
I 'm pleased .#### #### ####[]
Within 3 weeks the same issues started happening AGAIN .#### #### ####[]
But I do n't see it as a problem .#### #### ####[]
and if u did .#### #### ####[]
I HATE this one .#### #### ####[]
I have owned many computers and laptops .#### #### ####[]
This is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .#### #### ####[]
About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash .#### #### ####[]
There are so many things wrong with this product , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !#### #### ####[]
*4 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to Apple .#### #### ####[]
The apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding .#### #### ####[]
I love this computer .#### #### ####[]
The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite .#### #### ####[]
It is easy to find documents , and keep them in one area .#### #### ####[]
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !#### #### ####[]
Every single one we 've gotten we 've had problems with .#### #### ####[]
That being said after 2 weeks of owning every time I start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .#### #### ####[]
Now that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more .#### #### ####[]
Save your money and go for a better device .#### #### ####[]
My favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my Sony .#### #### ####[]
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .#### #### ####[]
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .#### #### ####[]
I do not plan on going back .#### #### ####[]
I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it .#### #### ####[]
Will probably never buy a HP again .#### #### ####[]
Satisfy what I paid for it .#### #### ####[]
THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be .#### #### ####[]
Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name .#### #### ####[]
It is truly a Desktop Replacement .#### #### ####[]
I 'm extremely happy with my purchase as I now have the portable power I have been looking for .#### #### ####[]
I honestly love my mac , thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict .#### #### ####[]
The acer one compuer is a great computer .#### #### ####[]
But the Macbook is the best !#### #### ####[]
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .#### #### ####[]
Do your research on this issue .#### #### ####[]
This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .#### #### ####[]
Do n't waste their money , save it and but a mac .#### #### ####[]
The benefits were immediate !#### #### ####[]
The only time I have restarted is during system updates .#### #### ####[]
What a waste of time it was to run a Defrag on the PC !#### #### ####[]
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .#### #### ####[]
I was so happy with my new Mac .#### #### ####[]
I 've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret buying it .#### #### ####[]
I am very happy I bought this Mac , well worth the extra money .#### #### ####[]
I fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now I could not imagine going back to an acer at all .#### #### ####[]
This laptop serves all my needs .#### #### ####[]
Ok first .#### #### ####[]
Having someone give you a quick tour of how to 's is the best .#### #### ####[]
Have returned that laptop unused .#### #### ####[]
They were able to set-up with labtops themselves within a few minutes .#### #### ####[]
There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .#### #### ####[]
There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .#### #### ####[]
What can I say .#### #### ####[]
Better stick with another brand .#### #### ####[]
After 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .#### #### ####[]
And I 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !#### #### ####[]
I would not recommend this product to anyone .#### #### ####[]
I can see why the have soooo much money .#### #### ####[]
I bought it for really cheap also and it 's AMAZING .#### #### ####[]
I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .#### #### ####[]
It can not save the correct date and time I set .#### #### ####[]
I was psyched .#### #### ####[]
*IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP , THIS IS NOT IT !#### #### ####[]
So do n't get it .#### #### ####[]
I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .#### #### ####[]
I had a toshiba for 10 years .#### #### ####[]
I am stuck with a laptop that I can not do very much with .#### #### ####[]
Well i got this computer from Best Buy and I have had nothing but problems I bought the computer with a virus ... ..#### #### ####[]
Love it .#### #### ####[]
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it ...#### #### ####[]
They transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .#### #### ####[]
It has happened again and I 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .#### #### ####[]
I am not happy at all with the product I purchased .#### #### ####[]
I would definitely not go back to using a PC after using the mac .#### #### ####[]
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .#### #### ####[]
Which is what I did , check out my ACER 5517 !#### #### ####[]
Obviously , this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way .#### #### ####[]
There are a few flaws as well that I noticed .#### #### ####[]
I own other Macs but always find myself navigation to the MacBook Pro to get my work done .#### #### ####[]
It all just makes sense .#### #### ####[]
One of the primary reasons why I purchased an IPad was to store photographs so that I could show to my customers .#### #### ####[]
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .#### #### ####[]
HP did n't fix it .#### #### ####[]
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months .#### #### ####[]
I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase !#### #### ####[]
Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Simply amazing computer ! !#### #### ####[]
Another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .#### #### ####[]
And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop .#### #### ####[]
I 'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up .#### #### ####[]
they will not let you down .#### #### ####[]
Have purchased many products over the years from MacConnection and this transaction , like all the others , we smoothly with no problems .#### #### ####[]
I 've owned every `` Pro '' model Apple laptop for the last 8 years , this is BY FAR the WORST one I 've ever had .#### #### ####[]
VERY disappointing :#### #### ####[]
The Awesomest of the awesomest .#### #### ####[]
( I definatly ca n't ) .#### #### ####[]
I am very pleased with my purchase !#### #### ####[]
We purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive HP needed to be repaired .#### #### ####[]
Unfortunately , that is not the case .#### #### ####[]
Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .#### #### ####[]
Well , maybe I was just very unlucky .#### #### ####[]
I have used PC 's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy .#### #### ####[]
I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in ( battle of the Smithsonian ) After on Hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % life left .#### #### ####[]
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase#### #### ####[]
So , if you 're thinking of a laptop , I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer ( Z0J80001 ) Notebook for all your needs !#### #### ####[]
When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school , I had a hard time from beginning .#### #### ####[]
I had to call Apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .#### #### ####[]
If you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac !#### #### ####[]
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what I 've done .#### #### ####[]
Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch .#### #### ####[]
It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .#### #### ####[]
C'mon , LG .#### #### ####[]
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer .#### #### ####[]
-They say it will take `` up to two weeks '' .#### #### ####[]
I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;#### #### ####[]
They are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .#### #### ####[]
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro .#### #### ####[]
It was n't worth it .#### #### ####[]
It is SO much fun to play with .#### #### ####[]
It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !#### #### ####[]
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .#### #### ####[]
I 'm going back to DELL .#### #### ####[]
I 'm Very disappointed in Dell .#### #### ####[]
I also experience the same with my MacBook Air .#### #### ####[]
I was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates .#### #### ####[]
it is the worst computer dell ever made .#### #### ####[]
I will not buy another one .#### #### ####[]
My last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .#### #### ####[]
A tip for people looking into this computer : DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .#### #### ####[]
The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly .#### #### ####[]
I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !#### #### ####[]
The computer is so slow , even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up .#### #### ####[]
Where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .#### #### ####[]
I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try .#### #### ####[]
Its still going .#### #### ####[]
My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made .#### #### ####[]
It was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again .#### #### ####[]
Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .#### #### ####[]
I was given a Mac as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .#### #### ####[]
At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .#### #### ####[]
Yet , HP wo n't do anything about the problem .#### #### ####[]
I 'm glad it waited , this one is great .#### #### ####[]
-Estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .#### #### ####[]
I 'm new - just switched from years of PC frustration .#### #### ####[]
Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .#### #### ####[]
The latest and mightiest Macbook pro 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of June 2009 .#### #### ####[]
I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .#### #### ####[]
My laptop worked again for just a while before I started having issues AGAIN .#### #### ####[]
Now , I guess , I 'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor , hapless soul .#### #### ####[]
With all the goodies inside this machine , it is a value .#### #### ####[]
I LOVE IT !#### #### ####[]
Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to Louisville Ky .#### #### ####[]
I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it .#### #### ####[]
It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click .#### #### ####[]
This is the first Apple product that I have purchased .#### #### ####[]
I believe this is because I was more active than the average user , meaning I average about three `` tabs '' .#### #### ####[]
It would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .#### #### ####[]
But , I would recommend this product .#### #### ####[]
It 's face and depanable .#### #### ####[]
Took that one home , same thing .#### #### ####[]
It is small enough to fit in one of my purses !#### #### ####[]
I would never buy a Dell again .#### #### ####[]
I am just amazed .#### #### ####[]
When the computer has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself .#### #### ####[]
Bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since `` learning how to use it '' .#### #### ####[]
I did n't like one thing about it .#### #### ####[]
Overall for the money this is a good deal .#### #### ####[]
Two times with in one month .#### #### ####[]
I investigated netbooks and saw the Toshiba NB305-N410BL .#### #### ####[]
I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6 '' .#### #### ####[]
Would buy 100 more of these if I could .#### #### ####[]
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS ! ! !#### #### ####[]
If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one .#### #### ####[]
People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .#### #### ####[]
If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it !#### #### ####[]
I hate to say this , but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then I would .#### #### ####[]
And , if you are going to deal with HP be careful .#### #### ####[]
If you can afford a new laptop , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .#### #### ####[]
So I 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .#### #### ####[]
I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college .#### #### ####[]
But not in this case .#### #### ####[]
WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER -- -- -- -- LOU#### #### ####[]
`` For one , I noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds .#### #### ####[]
Macs are designed for the `` frontal lobe challenged '' people out there .#### #### ####[]
I ordered four D620 laptops .#### #### ####[]
My laptop is almost 2yrs old and I have never had any problems with it .#### #### ####[]
This mac is great !#### #### ####[]
Overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .#### #### ####[]
I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac .#### #### ####[]
I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE .#### #### ####[]
So far , so good .#### #### ####[]
I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait .#### #### ####[]
I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it .#### #### ####[]
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop .#### #### ####[]
This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops .#### #### ####[]
This a starter notebook .#### #### ####[]
This is what they told me : It heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .#### #### ####[]
I would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .#### #### ####[]
So honestly , I was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and I was n't disappointed .#### #### ####[]
I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it .#### #### ####[]
However , a NETBOOK will be a different story .#### #### ####[]
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him .#### #### ####[]
BAck she goes !#### #### ####[]
We did n't because it was already over 2,400 dollars !#### #### ####[]
Best Buy laughed when I told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .#### #### ####[]
But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .#### #### ####[]
After about another month I had to send it in AGAIN to Acer for repairs .#### #### ####[]
This is a great machine !#### #### ####[]
Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba , I went with an Asus G73JH-x3 .#### #### ####[]
All the yada-yada .#### #### ####[]
I previously owned an HP desktop and a Dell laptop .#### #### ####[]
Originally bought it for my wife .#### #### ####[]
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .#### #### ####[]
Do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware ...#### #### ####[]
Probably wo n't work either .#### #### ####[]
But reasons we chose this Apple computer .#### #### ####[]
I can do pretty much 75 % of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table .#### #### ####[]
I can not even read what I am writing half of the time .#### #### ####[]
ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .#### #### ####[]
I should have kept my big , old HP .#### #### ####[]
It was over rated !#### #### ####[]
WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO !#### #### ####[]
Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .#### #### ####[]
Mac computers automatically `` defrag '' each time you start your computer .#### #### ####[]
The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .#### #### ####[]
They removed them and returned the computer to me .#### #### ####[]
I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .#### #### ####[]
Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .#### #### ####[]
2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection .#### #### ####[]
I was informed that I need to call some 0900 number first .#### #### ####[]
I really do n't like it , but I am stuck .#### #### ####[]
You may just lose 1 customer for now .#### #### ####[]
I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !#### #### ####[]
Once you go Mac , you ca n't go back !#### #### ####[]
Which was way too much money .#### #### ####[]
With a healthy pessimism , I took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .#### #### ####[]
So if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one , if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands Best Buy sells .#### #### ####[]
I am sorry that I purchased this laptop .#### #### ####[]
Received the product promptly and without any issues .#### #### ####[]
I started hainv problems with it within the first month .#### #### ####[]
I use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP , well , I 'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone !#### #### ####[]
The lesson learned here is : It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .#### #### ####[]
Being virus-resistant is a huge plus .#### #### ####[]
If you 're looking for a great laptop , you 've found the best here .#### #### ####[]
Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work .#### #### ####[]
I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .#### #### ####[]
I was very worried about making the two compatible- but literally , it was so simple I was almost worried that I was doing something wrong .#### #### ####[]
Just a month and a half or two months ago , my VAIO crashed again .#### #### ####[]
It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow .#### #### ####[]
Amazing machine .#### #### ####[]
Never been hacked .#### #### ####[]
Sure hope Best Buy will replace it asap .#### #### ####[]
I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC .#### #### ####[]
From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .#### #### ####[]
sounds like a typewriter , but if you can get past that , this is a great laptop for a little money !#### #### ####[]
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .#### #### ####[]
It is meant to be PORTABLE .#### #### ####[]
That day !#### #### ####[]
Breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4+ people to report the damaged part will be returned late !#### #### ####[]
They told me to reprogram the computer , and I did n't need to do that , and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life .#### #### ####[]
The cool thing about the Mac Book was that I went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iPhone , then I came back and put them onto my Macbook and made a pretty good DVD movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .#### #### ####[]
I like it so much , I bought another just for my wife .#### #### ####[]
They are not .#### #### ####[]
The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed .#### #### ####[]
I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !#### #### ####[]
Will certainly use MacConnection again .#### #### ####[]
So needless to day , I 'm not happy .#### #### ####[]
As it turns out , I just did n't know any better .#### #### ####[]
If anything , I would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to .#### #### ####[]
Again , I sent it off to Acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .#### #### ####[]
I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one .#### #### ####[]
I also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .#### #### ####[]
They 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .#### #### ####[]
My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .#### #### ####[]
After 3 pleasant weeks of use , the laptop just died .#### #### ####[]
One bad thing is it gets hot .#### #### ####[]
Exactly that , users .#### #### ####[]
I 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .#### #### ####[]
They informed me that I had around 7 `` policies '' or viruses on it .#### #### ####[]
I just love my Mac !#### #### ####[]
This is my 3rd Apple Laptop and first MacBook Pro .#### #### ####[]
So I 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? The darn thing would n't go back on .#### #### ####[]
Not working = bad#### #### ####[]
If you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .#### #### ####[]
If you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .#### #### ####[]
I asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .#### #### ####[]
I did n't want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice .#### #### ####[]
When the buyer returned it Wal Mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .#### #### ####[]
But I was wrong .#### #### ####[]
This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .#### #### ####[]
We are addicted to the Mac .#### #### ####[]
Purchased as a gift for a friend .#### #### ####[]
Thinking about returning it#### #### ####[]
It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing .#### #### ####[]
I should have bought one a long time ago .#### #### ####[]
I have a lapdesk which I can use , but I can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .#### #### ####[]
I just bought this laptop 3 days ago .#### #### ####[]
i tried turning it done but it did nothing .#### #### ####[]
Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product .#### #### ####[]
This machine was a horrible experience .#### #### ####[]
Might not make the avid gamer happy but I do n't really think that is what this computer is designed for .#### #### ####[]
This was my first MacBook purchase ever .#### #### ####[]
The book is useless .#### #### ####[]
Overall this laptop is great .#### #### ####[]
Either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !#### #### ####[]
dell is a decently made pc .#### #### ####[]
Before i bought my new i5 , I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .#### #### ####[]
i try to use it today and I ca n't logon .#### #### ####[]
I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .#### #### ####[]
DEFINITELY recommended ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Mom , Dad , Brother , sister , You name it !#### #### ####[]
I use it now more than I even thought I would .#### #### ####[]
I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .#### #### ####[]
The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .#### #### ####[]
All in all , I 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop , and with HP as a whole .#### #### ####[]
If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .#### #### ####[]
I 'm a professional consultant , and a client needed work on her machine .#### #### ####[]
Should be there by the end of the week ( again ... ) .#### #### ####[]
I 've never had problems with viruses .#### #### ####[]
NO good .#### #### ####[]
I should have realized that trouble was brewing .#### #### ####[]
I 've always used PC 's for work home and this is my first experience with a Mac .#### #### ####[]
I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it .#### #### ####[]
I bought it during the recent Comex IT show .#### #### ####[]
Problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school .#### #### ####[]
The 13 '' MacBook Pro is portable , durable , and very capable .#### #### ####[]
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned .#### #### ####[]
This is the first macbook I have ever had .#### #### ####[]
It is made better , thicker , and all out tough !#### #### ####[]
It 's not a recommendation , it ' a plea .#### #### ####[]
Honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .#### #### ####[]
Do n't waste your money !#### #### ####[]
That is how it is able to function better than any other PC .#### #### ####[]
Finally , I purchased a Toshiba .#### #### ####[]
Consumer Report recommended Toshiba .#### #### ####[]
Thank God for `` ctrl Z '' Bottom line , I 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .#### #### ####[]
I do n't really have a complaint .#### #### ####[]
They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything .#### #### ####[]
Recommended to people as their first laptop .#### #### ####[]
Files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .#### #### ####[]
That is my only complaint !#### #### ####[]
So this was great for me .#### #### ####[]
I can not even imaging going back to a PC after using this wonderful computer .#### #### ####[]
You will fall in love with it in no time .#### #### ####[]
Very small and portable I 've had this netbook about 12 hrs now and It 's better than expected .#### #### ####[]
three years is a decent life , but this must make it to graduation and beyond .#### #### ####[]
What a great little laptop .#### #### ####[]
I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town .#### #### ####[]
It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .#### #### ####[]
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .#### #### ####[]
I was WRONG !#### #### ####[]
That 's how frustrating it was .#### #### ####[]
I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke .#### #### ####[]
If you do n't like fingerprints , this might not be the laptop for you .#### #### ####[]
I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo n't even be dead .#### #### ####[]
Despite the plethora of problems , I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years .#### #### ####[]
Excellent product for the money .#### #### ####[]
it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop .#### #### ####[]
The Toshiba laptop was a great purchase .#### #### ####[]
compresses itself and you ca n't use it .#### #### ####[]
I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .#### #### ####[]
Two of the times was in one month .#### #### ####[]
Other than that I do n't have one complaint in the world !#### #### ####[]
Got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .#### #### ####[]
I work with kids and they love making short videos on there .#### #### ####[]
I was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain Flash .#### #### ####[]
I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well !#### #### ####[]
So , you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item .#### #### ####[]
I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .#### #### ####[]
It is super fast , and always loads .#### #### ####[]
-Complied to their protocol , called number , made `` case '' , got an email address to send complaint .#### #### ####[]
What 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .#### #### ####[]
While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I 've used .#### #### ####[]
I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter .#### #### ####[]
Apparently they 're not special anymore .#### #### ####[]
Do you ever think HP would do that ? NEVER !#### #### ####[]
`` I 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely LOVE IT .#### #### ####[]
It has everything you need to get the job done .#### #### ####[]
I did a review on it , its awesome .#### #### ####[]
That 's the downside for me .#### #### ####[]
It 's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it .#### #### ####[]
A couple things you should know :#### #### ####[]
Dismantle the whole thing ? Then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .#### #### ####[]
Sorry Toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .#### #### ####[]
Never any doubt I would get a MacBook , just was n't sure which one .#### #### ####[]
I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .#### #### ####[]
Ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple .#### #### ####[]
They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .#### #### ####[]
This is my second MACBOOK PRO and it 's better than ever .#### #### ####[]
I was n't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money !#### #### ####[]
Unfortunately , the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again , I have to say i hated it .#### #### ####[]
This is basically the best laptop I have ever had or used .#### #### ####[]
From the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .#### #### ####[]
This computer is absolutely AMAZING ! ! !#### #### ####[]
So I called , AGAIN .#### #### ####[]
I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I ca n't imagine ever going back .#### #### ####[]
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .#### #### ####[]
My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple .#### #### ####[]
No laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .#### #### ####[]
The advantages of owning ' a 'mac are numerous .#### #### ####[]
THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT .#### #### ####[]
99 to fix it .#### #### ####[]
It lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if I fired it up today , it would work .#### #### ####[]
I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .#### #### ####[]
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .#### #### ####[]
She told me flatly , `` It 's like that one .#### #### ####[]
That 's a huge difference .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't imagine EVER buying a PC again !#### #### ####[]
I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop .#### #### ####[]
I 'm glad I bought this laptop , it was worth the few ( $ 100 ) extra dollars .#### #### ####[]
I purchased two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .#### #### ####[]
For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop .#### #### ####[]
Sorry , newegg .#### #### ####[]
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac .#### #### ####[]
So , buyers beware !#### #### ####[]
Such as PAGES , NUMBERS , and so on .#### #### ####[]
I WILL NEVER AGAIN buy another Acer , not will I buy Gateway , or eMachine as they are all from the same company .#### #### ####[]
Recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .#### #### ####[]
Even set at the highest level , the computer sacrifices its queen every time .#### #### ####[]
I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal !#### #### ####[]
I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .#### #### ####[]
It out performs any other laptop on the market today .#### #### ####[]
returned it .#### #### ####[]
Its a dog plain and simple .#### #### ####[]
*3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Visited MacHouse Amsterdam .#### #### ####[]
After the first few months , the computer started crashing about every week .#### #### ####[]
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment .#### #### ####[]
Being a PC user my whole life ... .#### #### ####[]
In fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .#### #### ####[]
All of them were Windows machines .#### #### ####[]
UPDATE : Two years after buying this laptop , I am now the proud owner of a lemon .#### #### ####[]
They would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .#### #### ####[]
I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .#### #### ####[]
In summary , take your money elsewhere .#### #### ####[]
I believe I purchased this in Dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .#### #### ####[]
I would never tell anyone to buy one either .#### #### ####[]
Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac .#### #### ####[]
Looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level , I decided to purchase the MBP 15in Intel Core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop .#### #### ####[]
I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening .#### #### ####[]
My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates .#### #### ####[]
This is a great computer .#### #### ####[]
This laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery I have owned outside of the Iphone .#### #### ####[]
I really wish I had done this years ago .#### #### ####[]
I was starting to boil .#### #### ####[]
After years of using PCs , a new Mac user is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer .#### #### ####[]
During that time , I had to send it back 3 times .#### #### ####[]
I really wanted a Mac over a pc because I used a Mac in high school .#### #### ####[]
Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .#### #### ####[]
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .#### #### ####[]
I have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .#### #### ####[]
This laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials .#### #### ####[]
Went silently .#### #### ####[]
That was a big mistake .#### #### ####[]
I do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and I 'll never buy another one because I 've put more into it then it is worth .#### #### ####[]
My children wo n't even use it for their school work .#### #### ####[]
I loved it .#### #### ####[]
What a waste .#### #### ####[]
Let me start with the good : So awesome .#### #### ####[]
I claim that this has no value to me , the laptop was new anyway .#### #### ####[]
Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on .#### #### ####[]
I 'm now trying to decide on another Dell model .#### #### ####[]
Returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .#### #### ####[]
I spent 2200 dollars on a `` top of the line laptop '' .#### #### ####[]
Those things are very important - vital even !#### #### ####[]
So , I must say I am not a happy camper .#### #### ####[]
We do n't Mind and You do n't Matter .#### #### ####[]
However , If I sound enthusiastic about this , I am !#### #### ####[]
It does n't heat up like my old laptop .#### #### ####[]
I have had at least eight Toshiba laptops , and they have been outstanding , including this one .#### #### ####[]
I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .#### #### ####[]
Second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated#### #### ####[]
I went with him and we picked this one .#### #### ####[]
The Toshiba Mini Notebook , Model NB 305-N410BL , is a great little computer .#### #### ####[]
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this `` never '' happen ...#### #### ####[]
I am glad I did my research .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't say enough good for it !#### #### ####[]
it has had some problems .#### #### ####[]
These new problems were the final straws ;#### #### ####[]
-Apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days I send them the old computer .#### #### ####[]
She brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that `` It is like that one '' .#### #### ####[]
I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon did n't have it yet .#### #### ####[]
Now they are believers in the product .#### #### ####[]
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .#### #### ####[]
In short I would never buy a Compaq again .#### #### ####[]
Before I got my macbook , I owned a Dell laptop .#### #### ####[]
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .#### #### ####[]
The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .#### #### ####[]
Using this machine is like a mild form of torture .#### #### ####[]
I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .#### #### ####[]
I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present .#### #### ####[]
If the number of patrons in the Apple store are any indication , HP and other PC manufacturers need to take note .#### #### ####[]
This is my first computer purchase#### #### ####[]
Great overall .#### #### ####[]
Just for a stupid CD .#### #### ####[]
So it was only about 2 weeks ago .#### #### ####[]
i would have to say that overall its great !#### #### ####[]
I hate it .#### #### ####[]
Returning this as soon as I get out of work#### #### ####[]
It is the worst laptop ever#### #### ####[]
I have been a mac user since the mid 90s .#### #### ####[]
-Managed to send complaint email .#### #### ####[]
Not good for a person who gets online daily .#### #### ####[]
I really like the Mac 15.4in . Notebook , but its very pricey .#### #### ####[]
Maybe not the cutting edge ( Satellite L455D ) but it is a workhorse .#### #### ####[]
I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races .#### #### ####[]
I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY COLLEGE AGE GRANDCHILDREN AND THESE MACS ARE TOTALLY RELIABLE AND SUPPORT THEIR CLASS WORK 100 % OF THE TIME .#### #### ####[]
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .#### #### ####[]
its not bad just VERY VERY annoying .#### #### ####[]
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco , returned it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that computer .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommend for daily use .#### #### ####[]
His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test , and it was failing .#### #### ####[]
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it .#### #### ####[]
Because it IS a defective product .#### #### ####[]
Otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations .#### #### ####[]
its sad because their commercials are great .#### #### ####[]
I will never buy another HP computer .#### #### ####[]
All the customers that come in hate Dell .#### #### ####[]
We have n't had any problems with it at all .#### #### ####[]
My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best .#### #### ####[]
falls into the case .#### #### ####[]
Still pretty pricey , but I 've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .#### #### ####[]
I had finally reached my limit and broke down .#### #### ####[]
Sad very SAD .#### #### ####[]
I 've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it !#### #### ####[]
NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS .#### #### ####[]
The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable .#### #### ####[]
It has everything I would need for a home computer .#### #### ####[]
I got it for Christmas , and I was so excited to set it up !#### #### ####[]
I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac .#### #### ####[]
She tells me about it all the time but I tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going .#### #### ####[]
Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !#### #### ####[]
mac is extremely different than any other laptop .#### #### ####[]
Summary : After doing some investigation on the web , I have found that Toshiba NB205s are not chronically not booting .#### #### ####[]
However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything .#### #### ####[]
Just do n't waste your time and money on this .#### #### ####[]
The computer was delivered as promised .#### #### ####[]
They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !#### #### ####[]
I highly recommend this product !#### #### ####[]
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .#### #### ####[]
My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the PCs in our lives .#### #### ####[]
Dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime I called them with a problem .#### #### ####[]
Note that I do n't ordinarily take the time to write a review .#### #### ####[]
No viruses .#### #### ####[]
And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully .#### #### ####[]
Summary : Dont buy HP .#### #### ####[]
Sony , Acer , Dell , Packard Bell and Toshiba .#### #### ####[]
This computer is the ideal college companion .#### #### ####[]
Everything is falling apart internally and externally .#### #### ####[]
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .#### #### ####[]
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future .#### #### ####[]
I am very Happy !#### #### ####[]
My wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections I turn on should work .#### #### ####[]
I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair .#### #### ####[]
This comes in very handy for me as an educator .#### #### ####[]
But enough about that , I am an Apple convert for life .#### #### ####[]
I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .#### #### ####[]
The machine itself is alright .#### #### ####[]
This is my first LG product .#### #### ####[]
ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .#### #### ####[]
They freeze all the time .#### #### ####[]
It 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to WiFi and look up book reviews of books I might buy .#### #### ####[]
All I can say is W-O-W .#### #### ####[]
I am loyal to Apple .#### #### ####[]
I got this laptop on Black Friday .#### #### ####[]
So far , I have no complaints .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't begin to say how disappointed I am .#### #### ####[]
I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro .#### #### ####[]
Oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .#### #### ####[]
Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best !#### #### ####[]
This laptop leaves alot to be desired , I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice ...#### #### ####[]
I Hate it !#### #### ####[]
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others .#### #### ####[]
tosiba has a good reputation , my llast computer was an acer .#### #### ####[]
I still see the benefits of a PC when I do not know how to do something on my mac .#### #### ####[]
I would recommend this product .#### #### ####[]
If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job .#### #### ####[]
I fell in love with it .#### #### ####[]
The Notebook PC , Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .#### #### ####[]
I could have purchased a cheap computer to do what I 'm doing now !#### #### ####[]
Although I was promised about 10 hours , I found myself to a limited 7 hours ( which is still amazing ) .#### #### ####[]
One year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it .#### #### ####[]
I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer .#### #### ####[]
This laptop does everything I need it to very well .#### #### ####[]
The Apple MC371LL/A 2.4Ghz 15.4-inch MacBook Pro Notebook is a horrible waste of money .#### #### ####[]
The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers .#### #### ####[]
I waited and waited and no laptop .#### #### ####[]
It is just slow slow slow .#### #### ####[]
Of course , eMachines can not be made entirely to blame for this computer 's woes ;#### #### ####[]
I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .#### #### ####[]
The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .#### #### ####[]
) only to get another `` HP/Compaq '' piece of crap .#### #### ####[]
I use that alot on my desktop , so I am adjusting to not having it .#### #### ####[]
That 's right , no power , absolutely NOTHING .#### #### ####[]
i love ths notebook .#### #### ####[]
-Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam .#### #### ####[]
My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .#### #### ####[]
They are closed at 9pm eastern .#### #### ####[]
Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .#### #### ####[]
My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday .#### #### ####[]
When calling Dell for help , reurn , or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it .#### #### ####[]
I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months .#### #### ####[]
really no problems with the hand me down computers I received from my children .#### #### ####[]
Now I know !#### #### ####[]
This computer gets very hot , before shutting down .#### #### ####[]
EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems .#### #### ####[]
Steve Jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .#### #### ####[]
It 's solid .#### #### ####[]
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig ( you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this ) .#### #### ####[]
Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase .#### #### ####[]
It is the easiest computer I have ever used#### #### ####[]
I would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .#### #### ####[]
I go to purchase it on line , and I find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !#### #### ####[]
Bought it to use mostly for oline classes .#### #### ####[]
its more like a snail crawl .#### #### ####[]
It Was a great deal after all .#### #### ####[]
Lord HAVE MERCY !#### #### ####[]
Buy it , love it , and I promise you wo n't regret it .#### #### ####[]
Other Thoughts : Received replacement 16 Days later .#### #### ####[]
big mistake !#### #### ####[]
THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO .#### #### ####[]
Ive owned Apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember .#### #### ####[]
Needs constant repair .#### #### ####[]
It was a Waste of money from day one !#### #### ####[]
My only other complaint is that it gets really hot .#### #### ####[]
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .#### #### ####[]
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .#### #### ####[]
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .#### #### ####[]
Oh my goodness-I am not a happy camper .#### #### ####[]
Thank you for your great product !#### #### ####[]
I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products .#### #### ####[]
I 'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible .#### #### ####[]
The only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !#### #### ####[]
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one .#### #### ####[]
It 's a joke .#### #### ####[]
I am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .#### #### ####[]
But if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .#### #### ####[]
This was around three years , maybe four years ago .#### #### ####[]
Best Buy Rocks !#### #### ####[]
This one has had the same effect .#### #### ####[]
The first one I had was a 2006 model , not the Pro .#### #### ####[]
( For those old enough to remember , it is similar to Beta versus VHS .#### #### ####[]
Either way I 'm furious .#### #### ####[]
So not having my laptop was discouraging .#### #### ####[]
This netbook went bad on me after 3 days .#### #### ####[]
Emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit .#### #### ####[]
Finally , I could n't take it anymore and ordered my Apple .#### #### ####[]
Hieroglyphics are quite common .#### #### ####[]
I sit down and use my husband 's work PC and I do n't like it one bit .#### #### ####[]
With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down .#### #### ####[]
But , Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy .#### #### ####[]
I love my macbook pro !#### #### ####[]
PLEASE MAKE THESE !#### #### ####[]
Let me tell you , this machine is great .#### #### ####[]
As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .#### #### ####[]
I now own another Hewlitt Packard .#### #### ####[]
Hopefully Amazon will take this back .#### #### ####[]
I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I 've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb , 201#### #### ####[]
I droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues !#### #### ####[]
However , this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .#### #### ####[]
I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .#### #### ####[]
More relieved than anything .#### #### ####[]
It doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .#### #### ####[]
If you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 model , you should wait until the next update .#### #### ####[]
Buyers beware .#### #### ####[]
I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer .#### #### ####[]
This thing sucks !#### #### ####[]
Couldnt not use it .#### #### ####[]
Easy learning curve .#### #### ####[]
He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .#### #### ####[]
SO ? HOW CAN YOU SOLVE IT ? C'mon , I just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago .#### #### ####[]
5 months dead again .#### #### ####[]
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !#### #### ####[]
I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .#### #### ####[]
The computer is a dream come true .#### #### ####[]
It 's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else .#### #### ####[]
I got the first `` Blue screen of death '' in the early part of July .#### #### ####[]
apple and quess what , you have to send the whole laptop in , too bad , so sad#### #### ####[]
That being said , it still runs video in full screen decently .#### #### ####[]
NO more Lenovo for me .#### #### ####[]
It has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on .#### #### ####[]
This laptop has left me with a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth for Acer brand products .#### #### ####[]
Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up !#### #### ####[]
I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one , but IMO NO STARS#### #### ####[]
By Air sounds more like by truck to Me .#### #### ####[]
We were occasional Mac users before , but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford .#### #### ####[]
It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat .#### #### ####[]
The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .#### #### ####[]
I like it better than my big Dell Laptop .#### #### ####[]
I shipped out on Saturday , July 17 .#### #### ####[]
It is extremely user friendly and intuitive .#### #### ####[]
Great , quick laptop for the money .#### #### ####[]
They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .#### #### ####[]
It makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or sending them to an online print shop , or uploading them to Flickr or Facebook etc , is not hard at all .#### #### ####[]
Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII .#### #### ####[]
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .#### #### ####[]
For me , five stars is not enough .#### #### ####[]
Posted Nov 8 , 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook .#### #### ####[]
I 'm so glad I purchased a Mac and not another PC ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am .#### #### ####[]
Very happy .#### #### ####[]
There is nothing better .#### #### ####[]
I pondered very long over this decision .#### #### ####[]
got another 1 , and same issue .#### #### ####[]
I 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba .#### #### ####[]
I have now had it for 1.5 months and love it .#### #### ####[]
I will never buy anything from HP again !#### #### ####[]
I 've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye 'd the computer when I took it out of my bag .#### #### ####[]
The ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it .#### #### ####[]
I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME !#### #### ####[]
Buyer Beware .#### #### ####[]
Let 's just get this out of the way , I love Apple !#### #### ####[]
Also , you wo n't have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus .#### #### ####[]
I was so excited to receive the Toshiba L455 as a gift/bonus for some work I had done for a friend of mine !#### #### ####[]
I hate it !#### #### ####[]
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again .#### #### ####[]
I bought this netbook for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs .#### #### ####[]
I 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .#### #### ####[]
not the day received .#### #### ####[]
might have to buy one for me now , since I use it all the time .#### #### ####[]
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .#### #### ####[]
Yes , I have it on the highest available setting .#### #### ####[]
If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal .#### #### ####[]
I had less problems .#### #### ####[]
I enjoy very much my new Toshiba , purchased specifially for attending online schooling .#### #### ####[]
Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer ( Z0J80001 ) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .#### #### ####[]
I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .#### #### ####[]
Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .#### #### ####[]
I would Highly recommend this MacBook .#### #### ####[]
I 'm not going to lie , I 've never really liked the Acer brand in general .#### #### ####[]
It is not even a year old yet , so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone .#### #### ####[]
You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .#### #### ####[]
i would never go back any more , i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone .#### #### ####[]
It is so great , I can Hardly ever take my hands off it !#### #### ####[]
Bottom line , I doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .#### #### ####[]
I decided I wanted a laptop so I went into the BBY store .#### #### ####[]
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .#### #### ####[]
Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though .#### #### ####[]
Everything was so easy .#### #### ####[]
I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the Mac .#### #### ####[]
Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort , I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand .#### #### ####[]
The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .#### #### ####[]
I love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it .#### #### ####[]
I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased .#### #### ####[]
On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .#### #### ####[]
By the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !#### #### ####[]
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .#### #### ####[]
I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .#### #### ####[]
Clearly , there is something wrong with the product and LG did n't take up the responsibility .#### #### ####[]
It 's more expensive but well worth it in the long run .#### #### ####[]
I 'll wait and save up for a new one .#### #### ####[]
No machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .#### #### ####[]
It does n't have a lot of frills , but I did n't need any , and being able to buy what I needed , and not more than I needed was very important .#### #### ####[]
They definitely have a superior product !#### #### ####[]
Though you get a polite person , you often don t get a solution .#### #### ####[]
After the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .#### #### ####[]
My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got a pc ) .#### #### ####[]
No problems , no lock ups , no disappointments .#### #### ####[]
I recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it !#### #### ####[]
To list a few : They tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns , as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up .#### #### ####[]
I have recently converted back to a mac and I could n't be happier !#### #### ####[]
I 've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back .#### #### ####[]
Do not buy it !#### #### ####[]
Currently if I use the laptop I ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .#### #### ####[]
A little pricey but it is well , well worth it .#### #### ####[]
It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access .#### #### ####[]
Also , I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot , and not even sitting on anything to make it hot .#### #### ####[]
I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation .#### #### ####[]
also it is light weight compared to others .#### #### ####[]
I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .#### #### ####[]
It easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .#### #### ####[]
Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09 .#### #### ####[]
I do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .#### #### ####[]
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro !#### #### ####[]
We purchase the Dell XPS several years ago for my home business .#### #### ####[]
Many thanks , Overstock.com .#### #### ####[]
Otherwise , I love it !#### #### ####[]
i asked many people , search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy .#### #### ####[]
Well , I bought this laptop a month or two ago .#### #### ####[]
and finally i realized that mac is the best .#### #### ####[]
After paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .#### #### ####[]
I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .#### #### ####[]
I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .#### #### ####[]
Good laptop for the money .#### #### ####[]
I have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control+alt+delete business anymore .#### #### ####[]
Heck , I like all Mac computers , but they 're all WAY too pricey for the kind of economy the U.S. is going through .#### #### ####[]
As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .#### #### ####[]
Time will tell .#### #### ####[]
When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC .#### #### ####[]
they have not sent a new one nor called .#### #### ####[]
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .#### #### ####[]
I 'm very happy with this machine !#### #### ####[]
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .#### #### ####[]
-they lost my laptop for a month#### #### ####[]
Overall , this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase !#### #### ####[]
Luckily , Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead I got a refund and bought a mac .#### #### ####[]
for 2 months .#### #### ####[]
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE -- -- BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY .#### #### ####[]
After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .#### #### ####[]
I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .#### #### ####[]
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .#### #### ####[]
-Called MacHouse Amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .#### #### ####[]
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .#### #### ####[]
Not a bad laptop , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .#### #### ####[]
By this time I was regretting ever SEEING this machine on the shelf !#### #### ####[]
They click .#### #### ####[]
My Macbook was worth ( after 3 years of use ! ) $ 375 .#### #### ####[]
Do not purchase this laptop .#### #### ####[]
I LOVE it !#### #### ####[]
I 've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .#### #### ####[]
The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town- lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .#### #### ####[]
It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me .#### #### ####[]
Took it back as it was defective .#### #### ####[]
But as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi .#### #### ####[]
You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it .#### #### ####[]
I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .#### #### ####[]
I had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .#### #### ####[]
Very fast and efficient !#### #### ####[]
This is another reason to like the Mac .#### #### ####[]
If you are a person like me , more on the creative side , the mac has something for you too .#### #### ####[]
It is , however , very heavy .#### #### ####[]
And Toshiba is a quality supplier .#### #### ####[]
Look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while I cook .#### #### ####[]
The Hewitt Packard Pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop , before this I had a Dell desktop that I loved .#### #### ####[]
When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .#### #### ####[]
I do n't do any high tech stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play games , so I ca n't reccomend it if you are in the computer field .#### #### ####[]
You might think , I am new in this game , but I am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .#### #### ####[]
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if , since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it 's `` like new , '' I might have 8 months next time .#### #### ####[]
Being only 2 months old , I am not a happy camper !#### #### ####[]
I 've been having endless problems since I bought the computer - only 1 month ago#### #### ####[]
HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP , I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS .#### #### ####[]
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .#### #### ####[]
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go .#### #### ####[]
No I am generous calling it slow .#### #### ####[]
he ca n't stand it .#### #### ####[]
5 ) Cut my losses and sold it for parts#### #### ####[]
Money and time well spent !#### #### ####[]
Do you think the shop will give me a new set ? ? It will NOT !#### #### ####[]
she ca n't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system .#### #### ####[]
HP refused to give me a new one and Wal Mart refused to take it back .#### #### ####[]
Probbly the worst decision we ever made !#### #### ####[]
I would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend .#### #### ####[]
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour ... .#### #### ####[]
I bought for my son in the 2nd grade .#### #### ####[]
I think it was seventy nine plus tax .#### #### ####[]
The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased .#### #### ####[]
I have the A65 - right now it 's a paperweight .#### #### ####[]
It is held in place magnetically .#### #### ####[]
In the past few years , I 've had terrible experiences with HP .#### #### ####[]
Other Thoughts : Do not purchase this product .#### #### ####[]
I am a full Mac convert now .#### #### ####[]
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .#### #### ####[]
My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .#### #### ####[]
Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .#### #### ####[]
While the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the PC world .#### #### ####[]
This computer is really fast and I 'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to ...#### #### ####[]
All-in-all , I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone .#### #### ####[]
Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current , up to date HP Pavilion -- If I recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t .#### #### ####[]
this is starting off good .#### #### ####[]
I made the right decision .#### #### ####[]
I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from !#### #### ####[]
Guess I 'll stay away from HP .#### #### ####[]
Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba .#### #### ####[]
I loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .#### #### ####[]
It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .#### #### ####[]
Each time taking about 1 day or so .#### #### ####[]
I do not recommend this company or their products ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine .#### #### ####[]
I 'd recommend this laptop to anyone !#### #### ####[]
what an elegant , wonderful machine .#### #### ####[]
If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .#### #### ####[]
I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one .#### #### ####[]
It turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by Wal Mart .#### #### ####[]
Now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165.00 to $ 400 to fix the machine .#### #### ####[]
I already own an iPhone , and so the move just made more sense .#### #### ####[]
I have never had an experience like this .#### #### ####[]
Few viruses to catch ;#### #### ####[]
This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .#### #### ####[]
This laptop rocks ( only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple does n't support ) !#### #### ####[]
It is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .#### #### ####[]
Hope this helps !#### #### ####[]
It 's catatonic .#### #### ####[]
It was definelty a smart move .#### #### ####[]
Bought this gateway M-50 or 150 early 2007 .#### #### ####[]
bought notebook 07/2009 .#### #### ####[]
I complain again ...#### #### ####[]
I ca n't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print .#### #### ####[]
This machine rocks !#### #### ####[]
