The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made .#### #### ####[]

So in late March , early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .#### #### ####[]
I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating .#### #### ####[]
So , owing to these problems , I went out and got myself an Apple MacBook Pro , which I am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .#### #### ####[]
That includes transferring my music and movies .#### #### ####[]
When I turned it on , nothing .#### #### ####[]
I realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .#### #### ####[]
So you might ask , what did Apple do for me ?#### #### ####[]
Overall , still a very nice machine .#### #### ####[]
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop !#### #### ####[]
The `` Time remaining '' goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .#### #### ####[]

Take the simple , easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around .#### #### ####[]

I love this laptop , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .#### #### ####[]
on the bright side at least I was n't without my laptop for long this time !#### #### ####[]
But if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .#### #### ####[]
An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .#### #### ####[]
By week two , my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much .#### #### ####[]
The love part of my relationship with this laptop does n't take very long .#### #### ####[]
In my house , HP is a nasty word .#### #### ####[]
I can actually get work done with this MAC , and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop .#### #### ####[]
Again .#### #### ####[]
It is amazing .#### #### ####[]
I Contacted HP about this situation and was given excuses , without results .#### #### ####[]
1 ) Payed $ 2200 for a `` premium '' laptop#### #### ####[]
I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me .#### #### ####[]
I Love my new computer !#### #### ####[]
I love this little one .#### #### ####[]
I had a MacBook Notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .#### #### ####[]
But let me tell you , the mac book pro is so professional .#### #### ####[]
All was well .#### #### ####[]
We did not even have it a year .#### #### ####[]
This is the first laptop I 've owned , althougth I used several at my previous job .#### #### ####[]
I have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .#### #### ####[]

Okay , let 's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy .#### #### ####[]
If I had to buy another computer , I would most definetly buy an acer one computer .#### #### ####[]
I 'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE .#### #### ####[]
They basically told me that the machine would be problem free now .#### #### ####[]
I have used both PCs and Macs and I have to say that I really really love my Mac Book Pro .#### #### ####[]
I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box !#### #### ####[]
Very disappointed !#### #### ####[]
Oh , boy !#### #### ####[]
They do n't crash .#### #### ####[]

Basic computer .#### #### ####[]
He said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .#### #### ####[]
I would recommend Mac , and do , to anyone looking to buy a new computer .#### #### ####[]
It is a cheap throw together .#### #### ####[]
It was a bad experience but i played down its importance .#### #### ####[]
We 'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again !#### #### ####[]
Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .#### #### ####[]
The notebook would not turn back on again .#### #### ####[]
I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop !#### #### ####[]
I am just ONE of the million customers .#### #### ####[]
This computer was bought because I wanted `` top of the line '' , fast , reliable , HA .#### #### ####[]
Since I purchased my Toshiba netbook , I have been very pleased with it , I have a laptob and a desktop .#### #### ####[]
It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting .#### #### ####[]
I waited another month for approval and for them to `` BUILD '' me a new laptop .#### #### ####[]
In those three years , I 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily .#### #### ####[]
No big deal .#### #### ####[]
So , I went back .#### #### ####[]
I have used different laptops in the past and I have to rate this one way above the rest .#### #### ####[]
just chill and enjoy .#### #### ####[]
It quit working within a weeks time .#### #### ####[]
All you have to do is turn it on and it works .#### #### ####[]
Looking online , many people are having the same problem .#### #### ####[]
I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters .#### #### ####[]
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .#### #### ####[]
It 's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .#### #### ####[]
This ai n't it .#### #### ####[]
I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .#### #### ####[]
My wife also has problems with her Asus - different model .#### #### ####[]
*6th week*-They are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit ...#### #### ####[]
Well , maybe more like week one .#### #### ####[]
We used PC products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .#### #### ####[]

I absolutely love my mac !#### #### ####[]

It 's great and we will always stick with Apple computers , we have been so happy with them .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommended !#### #### ####[]
I ca n't even remember how I finally got it taken care of , but I was done with Sony after that !#### #### ####[]
They said it was a computer error on this type of computer .#### #### ####[]
Overall , it 's ok .#### #### ####[]
This was the second computer and brand bought that day .#### #### ####[]
I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling .#### #### ####[]
In my line of work , I often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .#### #### ####[]
It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more .#### #### ####[]
This worked just fine .#### #### ####[]
I have been a PC user since middle school , but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side , or should I say the brighter side of life .#### #### ####[]
The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !#### #### ####[]
HP said I had done the damage .#### #### ####[]
My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment .#### #### ####[]
It super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .#### #### ####[]
I tell everyone that I know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .#### #### ####[]
Dells are ok , HPs are n't that good , but Macs or Fantastic .#### #### ####[]
I respond that I do not have the old computer ...#### #### ####[]
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it .#### #### ####[]
It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made .#### #### ####[]
I normally dont participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts ...#### #### ####[]
but it came back in even worse shape .#### #### ####[]
I let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and she used it with ease .#### #### ####[]
I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far , and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it .#### #### ####[]
Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .#### #### ####[]
So buyer beware when buying Toshiba#### #### ####[]
It 's very annoying .#### #### ####[]
And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro .#### #### ####[]
Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .#### #### ####[]
That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .#### #### ####[]
Now , the next issue I had freaked me out .#### #### ####[]
I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem .#### #### ####[]
So a couple of years later , I was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .#### #### ####[]
I bought my Acer Aspire custom made in June 2008 .#### #### ####[]
Before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .#### #### ####[]
I highly recommend that you buy this product .#### #### ####[]
Do I like the computer ? Well , other than not getting viruses , I guess it is OK .#### #### ####[]
( I 'm an excellent touch typist , and my hands are very sensitive , too .#### #### ####[]
But while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with Apple .#### #### ####[]
The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop .#### #### ####[]
It is as good as new .#### #### ####[]
Very satisfied .#### #### ####[]
All in all great item highly recommend it .#### #### ####[]
By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student , so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .#### #### ####[]
I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .#### #### ####[]
Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .#### #### ####[]
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .#### #### ####[]
I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .#### #### ####[]
This is definitely a computer worth the money ;#### #### ####[]
I just ca n't fathom that the celebrated Dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .#### #### ####[]
The Toshiba Satellite laptop is DESIGNED to fail !#### #### ####[]
Never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .#### #### ####[]
I 've had a Toshiba laptop in the past ;#### #### ####[]
Much of which HP ended up paying for .#### #### ####[]
Sent unit back and it 's been two months .#### #### ####[]
It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .#### #### ####[]
I took it back for a full refund .#### #### ####[]
I thought it would be a simple job .#### #### ####[]
Laptop is to be used like a Netbook .#### #### ####[]
I have had my new Macbook Pro i5 for a couple of days and have recycled ALL of my old PC laptops .#### #### ####[]
This is the third MacBook Pro in our family .#### #### ####[]
They did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .#### #### ####[]
but other then that I would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .#### #### ####[]
Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook , I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros .#### #### ####[]
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15 '' Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .#### #### ####[]
It was a laugh too !#### #### ####[]
I would definitely suggest this laptop !#### #### ####[]
I like this machine because its very lightweight ...#### #### ####[]
Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient .#### #### ####[]
It crashes , and when it goes flat , it just DIES ( like a PC , maybe worse ) and I loose all my open documents !#### #### ####[]
Do n't buy this model .#### #### ####[]
And it did n't show up on the reciept , I do n't know how we ordered it online !#### #### ####[]
It took so much time .#### #### ####[]
I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13 '' in April , and I loved it .#### #### ####[]
I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .#### #### ####[]
I 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old ' way - and Apple does , indeed , have the better idea .#### #### ####[]
It is very durable , I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .#### #### ####[]
I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and I would n't have the same problems because it was updated .#### #### ####[]
I got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year .#### #### ####[]
I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .#### #### ####[]
for two months , when YOU GUESSED IT .#### #### ####[]
So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped .#### #### ####[]
This computer was awful !#### #### ####[]
I had never owned a Mac before ;#### #### ####[]
It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact , and I am certainly glad I did .#### #### ####[]
We both recently got new laptops .#### #### ####[]
My son said it popped up and he clicked update .#### #### ####[]
I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair .#### #### ####[]
without a big ol ' clunky machine in my backpack , I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere .#### #### ####[]
Prior to this computer , I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a laptop ) .#### #### ####[]
If you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .#### #### ####[]
I 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !#### #### ####[]
I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .#### #### ####[]
Very annoying .#### #### ####[]
I babyed the heck out of it and i still do .#### #### ####[]
I took the laptop home and not even a month later , I began to have problems with it .#### #### ####[]
I went from BestBuy to Dell , Windows to Apple .#### #### ####[]
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile .#### #### ####[]
It took me a while top get away from the land of PCs , but now that I have , I ca n't see myself going back to it .#### #### ####[]
This is perfect for her field .#### #### ####[]
This laptop is insane ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I love it so much .#### #### ####[]
So you out of of notebook and money .#### #### ####[]
Not worth it one bit .#### #### ####[]
I have had a Mac for 6 years and wo n't go back to PC .#### #### ####[]
We were PC users .#### #### ####[]
It is quiet and a real joy to watch work .#### #### ####[]
I occassionaly use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems .#### #### ####[]
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba .#### #### ####[]
I 'm just really happy that I waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !#### #### ####[]
I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop .#### #### ####[]
This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone .#### #### ####[]
And this is n't just my one experine .#### #### ####[]
On 3 July 2004 , I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $ 150#### #### ####[]
The computer would not ever cut back on .#### #### ####[]
*2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is `` on the top of the stack '' .#### #### ####[]
And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed .#### #### ####[]
They have more problems then a 1980 's computer .#### #### ####[]
It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .#### #### ####[]
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem .#### #### ####[]
I did not take the class and wish that I would have .#### #### ####[]
been a PC user for many , many years .#### #### ####[]
I just got this laptop for college , and so far I am very happy with it .#### #### ####[]
In short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing Rover your dog ) .#### #### ####[]
However , this will be my last as well .#### #### ####[]
The bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .#### #### ####[]
Fast , fast and fast , the web pages just fly by .#### #### ####[]
About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro , which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro .#### #### ####[]
Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall ? Yeah , I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire .#### #### ####[]
YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR .#### #### ####[]
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !#### #### ####[]
Received all four in good order ;#### #### ####[]
I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .#### #### ####[]
I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus .#### #### ####[]
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .#### #### ####[]
They sent it off and within 2 weeks I had it back good as new .#### #### ####[]
Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .#### #### ####[]
Thank you .#### #### ####[]
I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC .#### #### ####[]
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled .#### #### ####[]
The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but thats the only bad thing about this computer .#### #### ####[]
I got a mac as my HS graduation gift .#### #### ####[]
Yeah , to you .#### #### ####[]
I would highly recommend this one to my friends#### #### ####[]
My previous purchases were with Dell and HP .#### #### ####[]
This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it !#### #### ####[]
I do n't know how I could ever live without my Qousmio .#### #### ####[]
I will be patient for few months .#### #### ####[]
I saw this one , and I have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , I hate putting this computer down#### #### ####[]
It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop !#### #### ####[]
I love my Samsung TV and Galaxy S smartphone , but this Netbook was a very poor computer .#### #### ####[]
They are so realistic I am just speechless .#### #### ####[]
NOT WITH APPLE .#### #### ####[]
Be safe buy a Sony .#### #### ####[]
I have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these laptops .#### #### ####[]
The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .#### #### ####[]
It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived .#### #### ####[]
they respond : `` your dissatisfaction is noted '' ...#### #### ####[]
PDF files can be viewed instantly .#### #### ####[]
She said its very user friendly .#### #### ####[]
I have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .#### #### ####[]
I 've only had mine a day but I 'm already used to it ...#### #### ####[]
It started out getting hot after only a few months .#### #### ####[]
Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV .#### #### ####[]
No waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .#### #### ####[]
But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Summary : Spend your money elsewhere#### #### ####[]
I look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .#### #### ####[]
I paid about the same for my Toshiba as I did for the compaq a few years back .#### #### ####[]
Do n't waste your money or time .#### #### ####[]
I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident ( long story ) .#### #### ####[]
I shopped around before buying .#### #### ####[]
This machine delivers .#### #### ####[]
I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky ! !#### #### ####[]
On the twelfth day that I had the notebook , I decided to go to Dell 's website and update it .#### #### ####[]
GREAT INVESTMENT !#### #### ####[]
I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email .#### #### ####[]
very very slow laptop .#### #### ####[]
MACS ARE AMAZING ! ! !#### #### ####[]
