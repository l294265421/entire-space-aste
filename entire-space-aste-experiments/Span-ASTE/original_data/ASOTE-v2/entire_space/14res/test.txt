Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST !#### #### ####[]
since the first time I came here I 've been hooked .#### #### ####[]
People in the neighborhood seem to love it , too .#### #### ####[]

Nick Stef 's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area , so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Herald 's Square check it out !#### #### ####[]
Have to tell you : Not at all impressed .#### #### ####[]
How have I never been to Agave before ?#### #### ####[]
You 're going to drop some coin , but completely worth it , especially if you are looking to impress someone .#### #### ####[]
My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES .#### #### ####[]
A nice find in the neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
And as SOON as one person is done , she asked to pick up the plate immediately .#### #### ####[]
This place is Italian , not French .#### #### ####[]

I decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines .#### #### ####[]
Having moved I truly miss this place .#### #### ####[]
SUM IT : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .#### #### ####[]
I started going to dosa hut more after that .#### #### ####[]
Too bad , has a lot of potential .#### #### ####[]
Siam Square is fairly new to the neighborhood and I think in time will gain the recognition it deserves .#### #### ####[]

The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm .#### #### ####[]
This is a real gem of a place .#### #### ####[]
I think this a a wonderful place .#### #### ####[]
This place does n't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does , but it should .#### #### ####[]
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter does n't mean we should be automatically impressed .#### #### ####[]
Like I said , Nick and Joe 's may not be everyone 's favorite , but it 's mine .#### #### ####[]
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us .#### #### ####[]

Being a vegan myself , I 've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in Manhattan -- and Zen Palate is easily my favorite .#### #### ####[]
Don Pedro 's is one of my favorite restaurants .#### #### ####[]
Cantinetta is a real treasure in a see of mediocre Italian restaurants .#### #### ####[]
Whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective .#### #### ####[]

You will not be missing anything .#### #### ####[]
I discovered Applebees when I went away to college in VA .#### #### ####[]
I often find myself with time to kill in Times Square , which is a shame since I do n't love this area .#### #### ####[]
This place is average ... at best .#### #### ####[]
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be .#### #### ####[]
After reading the great reviews , I invited a die-hard downtown friend of mine to join me at TASTE .#### #### ####[]
Feels like family when we go there .#### #### ####[]
What a pleasant surprise !#### #### ####[]
It 's no-fuss , fast and delicious .#### #### ####[]
It was delish and I did n't feel bad eating it .#### #### ####[]
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination .#### #### ####[]
i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too .#### #### ####[]
I 'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away ... been going there on and off for a year now and it 's really my fave hang out in the city .#### #### ####[]
It first came well done , and I politely sent it back .#### #### ####[]
Do n't waste your time or your money .#### #### ####[]
it 's good but , like the movie is never as good as the book , this is same analogy .#### #### ####[]
it was a very warm experience .#### #### ####[]
I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it 's not a cheap night out ... but it 's SO worth it .#### #### ####[]
expectations were real hi reading the '10 's ' .#### #### ####[]
It 's nice to find a place that is open 24 hours ( especially in downtown Brooklyn ) .#### #### ####[]
We live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened .#### #### ####[]
I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it .#### #### ####[]
Both were very good , but nothing you could n't get at similar restaurant .#### #### ####[]
If you 're lucky and there 's not a private party going on back there , you 'll get a chance to really chill out .#### #### ####[]
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip .#### #### ####[]
Actually , everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed .#### #### ####[]
You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here .#### #### ####[]
We 'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night .#### #### ####[]
SUM IT : do n't read the '10 's ' reviews , try it to judge for yourself so you wo n't have as hi expectations , then you 'll be sure to enjoy it .#### #### ####[]
We went there , no one greeted us .#### #### ####[]
We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left .#### #### ####[]
I have been in NYC for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the Hudson .#### #### ####[]
We were there March 7 and found Maison very nice .#### #### ####[]
went there last night with my coworker .#### #### ####[]
Alias is warm and cozy and you do n't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 Clinton .#### #### ####[]
This is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business !#### #### ####[]
I would not recommend MEET at all , it is a rip off all the way from the time to step in !#### #### ####[]
Went there for a special celebration .#### #### ####[]
The restaurant was quiet and intimate .#### #### ####[]
OK , I 've been to Dumont a few times now .#### #### ####[]
Maybe it 's that most of Dumont 's patrons are younger and have lower expectations , but I can not recommend Dumont .#### #### ####[]
I 've been to Sotto Voce several time , and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !#### #### ####[]
This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York .#### #### ####[]
It took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again ! !#### #### ####[]
I read about this place in Time Out magazine .#### #### ####[]
It 's a great find in Astoria .#### #### ####[]
Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love .#### #### ####[]
It 's always quiet because it 's awful .#### #### ####[]
I have to say the place was awesome .#### #### ####[]
The restaurant could use a little paint , but all in all a great sushi place !#### #### ####[]
My friends and I go once a week ( minimum , we live in the area ) and everytime ca n't resist walking out ready to burst .#### #### ####[]
Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to , but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine .#### #### ####[]
Do n't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review .#### #### ####[]
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there .#### #### ####[]
It 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .#### #### ####[]
Before the place did n't call my attention .#### #### ####[]
But now that it 's under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great .#### #### ####[]
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here .#### #### ####[]
I do n't remember what we had ; nothing was memorable .#### #### ####[]
It is bland and nothing extrodinary .#### #### ####[]
Every time I visit NYC , I come here .#### #### ####[]
I 've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago .#### #### ####[]
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this was n't a place we 'd return to .#### #### ####[]
Weekends can get crowded , but still highly recommended .#### #### ####[]
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early .#### #### ####[]
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat .#### #### ####[]
