I would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not THAT great .#### #### ####[([6], [2, 3], 'NEG')]
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , Katz 's has a charm about it .#### #### ####[([11, 13], [10], 'POS')]

Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'POS')]

I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .#### #### ####[([7], [11], 'NEG'), ([15], [11], 'NEG'), ([48], [-1], '-'), ([65, 66], [-1], '-'), ([70, 71], [-1], '-'), ([35], [-1], '-'), ([39], [-1], '-'), ([51], [-1], '-'), ([57], [-1], '-')]

Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre .#### #### ####[]
So rude .#### #### ####[]
I have been going back again and again .#### #### ####[]
We were exploring Grand Central and did n't want to eat in the food court .#### #### ####[]
Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded .#### #### ####[]
I will never visit this restaurant again .#### #### ####[]
After reading the posts , I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow , despite living in Park Slope .#### #### ####[]
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience .#### #### ####[]
Of course , it is crowded but who cares .#### #### ####[]
Everyone is welcomed in as family .#### #### ####[]
Alain Ducasse is the best of everything , I mean everything was excelent.I#### #### ####[]
They are located in the middle of Chinatown !#### #### ####[]
Ciao Bella#### #### ####[]
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .#### #### ####[]
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .#### #### ####[]
Its located in greenewich village .#### #### ####[]
Keep up the good work guys !#### #### ####[]
Stay away from this place .#### #### ####[]
I 've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy 's Bronx Cafe .#### #### ####[]
I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .#### #### ####[]
I do n't live in NY but my best friend does .#### #### ####[]
I do n't get it either .#### #### ####[]
I would highly recommend .#### #### ####[]
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .#### #### ####[]
Buon appetito !#### #### ####[]
I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got !#### #### ####[]
SO SO SO SO SO good !#### #### ####[]
This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come .#### #### ####[]
I recommend ordering in on a weeknight .#### #### ####[]
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .#### #### ####[]
Good for dates or with friends .#### #### ####[]
Although , one night we went it was super cheesy , and another night it was less cheesy .#### #### ####[]
Nice find .#### #### ####[]
Just an odd group .#### #### ####[]
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )#### #### ####[]
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated .#### #### ####[]
What 's the difference between the two ?#### #### ####[]
Was surprisingly disappointed .#### #### ####[]
I often go there to eat with my family .#### #### ####[]
I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .#### #### ####[]
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !#### #### ####[]
Warning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !#### #### ####[]
What more could you want ?#### #### ####[]
Another welcome addition to the neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
I 've been to this monster sushi twice , the 46th st once , the 23rd st one a number of times .#### #### ####[]
But people from Sichuan will die for it ) - Chongqing Hot Pot , chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan , now became an independent province .#### #### ####[]
I will be going back very soon .#### #### ####[]
I suspect this restaurant is what Rao 's would be if it had n't turned exclusive .#### #### ####[]
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .#### #### ####[]
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .#### #### ####[]
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years .#### #### ####[]
I have lived in NY for many years and have dined at many restaraunts .#### #### ####[]
It is sometimes a little cramped , and can get a little warm , but hello , it 's NYC !#### #### ####[]
SEA has become so popular that they 've let it go to their heads .#### #### ####[]
Perhaps the last reviewer ( who stated she was treated with attitude ) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda .#### #### ####[]
I 'm from sichuan , this is the restaurant I recommend going .#### #### ####[]
My roommate and I LOVE this place .#### #### ####[]
I 'm going back .#### #### ####[]
We will come back ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Gigino 's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable .#### #### ####[]
I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn .#### #### ####[]
Not what I wanted to hear .#### #### ####[]
Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommended to all !#### #### ####[]
And that 's no mean feat ...#### #### ####[]
Even with John 's and Joe 's around the corner , this place will make a name for itself .#### #### ####[]
I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it .#### #### ####[]
I 've eaten at many different Indian restaurants .#### #### ####[]
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !#### #### ####[]
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years .#### #### ####[]
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .#### #### ####[]
i 'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i 've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning .#### #### ####[]
And everytime I go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front .#### #### ####[]
I was wrong .#### #### ####[]
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend .#### #### ####[]
For $ 760 for 2 people , it 's a once in a lifetime experience .#### #### ####[]
I loved it and will be back soon .#### #### ####[]
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who do n't know what they are doing .#### #### ####[]
It hits the spot every time#### #### ####[]
I plan on stopping by next week as well .#### #### ####[]
The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead .#### #### ####[]
I live nearby and when they first opened , I ate there a lot .#### #### ####[]
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .#### #### ####[]
For those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n't get it .#### #### ####[]
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .#### #### ####[]
Our teenage kids love it , too .#### #### ####[]
I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon#### #### ####[]
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .#### #### ####[]
Hey , I think $ 2+ for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .#### #### ####[]
It 's like you are transported to the Italian countryside , very romantic and filled with antiques .#### #### ####[]
Just go and see for yourself .#### #### ####[]
Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I 'm in NYC .#### #### ####[]
I was a little leary about Mary 's at first - it 's small , crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I 'm glad I finally tried it .#### #### ####[]
Over 100 different choices to create your own .#### #### ####[]
We were pleasantly greeted .#### #### ####[]
I love this place !#### #### ####[]
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant , I decided to give it a try with two friends .#### #### ####[]
But trust me it is so worth it .#### #### ####[]
And its absolutely DELICIOUS .#### #### ####[]
But $ 1 for each small piece ? ? ?#### #### ####[]
Enjoy !#### #### ####[]
I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there .#### #### ####[]
Okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .#### #### ####[]
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .#### #### ####[]
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .#### #### ####[]
Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater .#### #### ####[]
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .#### #### ####[]
Its not the same if you have to sit inside .#### #### ####[]
Came looking for this place because I heard good things .#### #### ####[]
We visit at least once a month .#### #### ####[]
We were less than impressed .#### #### ####[]
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible !#### #### ####[]
It can be a very fun experience with a group , and kids ( 6 and over ) would love it .#### #### ####[]
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .#### #### ####[]
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY -- I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .#### #### ####[]
What for ?#### #### ####[]
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .#### #### ####[]
My friends and I showed up on a Sat .#### #### ####[]
NO PIZZA 33 for me !#### #### ####[]
Would definitely go back again .#### #### ####[]
I 'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good .#### #### ####[]
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .#### #### ####[]
Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out .#### #### ####[]
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars !#### #### ####[]
It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us .#### #### ####[]
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening .#### #### ####[]
This is a true gem of the village .#### #### ####[]
Everything a NY pizza joint should be .#### #### ####[]
Perhaps .#### #### ####[]
All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .#### #### ####[]
Get it together .#### #### ####[]
My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended .#### #### ####[]
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you , brother ?#### #### ####[]
I love this place .#### #### ####[]
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde !#### #### ####[]
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better , but it was not !#### #### ####[]
It 's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials .#### #### ####[]
I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .#### #### ####[]
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip .#### #### ####[]
Please take my advice , go and try this place .#### #### ####[]
Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers .#### #### ####[]
Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .#### #### ####[]
Planet Thai is great !#### #### ####[]
Nice value .#### #### ####[]
I will definetely go back again and again , that 's for sure ! ! !#### #### ####[]
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .#### #### ####[]
It 's only $ 1.95 for a regular slice and $ 4.00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms .#### #### ####[]
too large for just two people but nothing was left .#### #### ####[]
Big and gawky on the outside .#### #### ####[]
I 've never been treated so rudely .#### #### ####[]
... and that 's saying a lot .#### #### ####[]
A must try !#### #### ####[]
Leave the kids at home !#### #### ####[]
Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .#### #### ####[]
It was good , but was not what I thought it would be .#### #### ####[]
I will not be coming here at 3am again .#### #### ####[]
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito 's home .#### #### ####[]
Ca n't wait to go back .#### #### ####[]
No , really .#### #### ####[]
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there .#### #### ####[]
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE .#### #### ####[]
It was raining , and we figured why not ?#### #### ####[]
Have eaten at Ginger House several times , and it 's always good .#### #### ####[]
I 've been here twice now .#### #### ####[]
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .#### #### ####[]
Finally , after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be .#### #### ####[]
Read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .#### #### ####[]
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already , you know it 's going to be good .#### #### ####[]
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .#### #### ####[]
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair .#### #### ####[]
This place started off a little iffy , but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC ( and I 'm indian , so I should know ) .#### #### ####[]
Sexy .#### #### ####[]
I was glad I did .#### #### ####[]
A little crowded but they move that line really fast !#### #### ####[]
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at 'Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip .#### #### ####[]
and never strayed .#### #### ####[]
My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .#### #### ####[]
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .#### #### ####[]
Probably would not go again ...#### #### ####[]
Seriously , this place kicks ass .#### #### ####[]
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary .#### #### ####[]
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I 've experienced the same with other restaurants so I do n't appreciate such practice .#### #### ####[]
Be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it !#### #### ####[]
Too cold to enjoy .#### #### ####[]
Secondly , on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume .#### #### ####[]
Check it out .#### #### ####[]
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .#### #### ####[]
Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you do n't want to drop a ton of cash .#### #### ####[]
If you 're in town , it 's worth searching for another place .#### #### ####[]
I really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central .#### #### ####[]
I 'm amazed we have n't been kicked out of this place yet .#### #### ####[]
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .#### #### ####[]
Oh and it 's too tiny for families with strollers .#### #### ####[]
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .#### #### ####[]
Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .#### #### ####[]
You can not go wrong with this place .#### #### ####[]
Nothing special about this place .#### #### ####[]
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it !#### #### ####[]
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .#### #### ####[]
Will give it another chance before I write it off .#### #### ####[]
