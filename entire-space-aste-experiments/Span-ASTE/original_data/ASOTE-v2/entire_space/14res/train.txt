I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .#### #### ####[([16], [13], 'POS'), ([16], [15], 'POS'), ([21], [19, 20], 'POS'), ([40], [39], 'POS'), ([30], [27, 28], 'POS'), ([32, 33], [27, 28], 'POS'), ([43], [-1], '-'), ([24], [-1], '-')]

- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter 's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .#### #### ####[([2], [7, 8], 'POS'), ([16], [18], 'POS'), ([42, 51], [-1], '-'), ([55], [-1], '-'), ([30, 38], [-1], '-')]

I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies .#### #### ####[]
By the time we were done , it was past 1:00am .#### #### ####[]
Molto bene !#### #### ####[]
This is a fun restaurant to go to .#### #### ####[]
Also , the place is popular with families , so if you 're bothered by children running loose like wild animals , come later at night to avoid them .#### #### ####[]
THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST .#### #### ####[]
Old school meets New world .#### #### ####[]
You ca n't go wrong with this place .#### #### ####[]
Give it a try and enjoy .#### #### ####[]
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .#### #### ####[]
Bravo , Blue Hill !#### #### ####[]
Skip Baroanda down the street ( Eurotrashy , snooty and expensive ) and check this place out !#### #### ####[]
Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again , I will certainly stop by .#### #### ####[]
It 's a small cute restaurant .#### #### ####[]
I came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since .#### #### ####[]
Avoid this place !#### #### ####[]
Never again !#### #### ####[]
They outshine HH .#### #### ####[]
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .#### #### ####[]
Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly , helpful , and willing to the extra mile for a customer .#### #### ####[]
A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town .#### #### ####[]
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .#### #### ####[]
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .#### #### ####[]
Bleecker St Pizza is the best !#### #### ####[]
P.S . Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .#### #### ####[]
Would definitely visit again .#### #### ####[]
They brought glasses and the bottle , and just left the bottle at our table .#### #### ####[]
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .#### #### ####[]
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .#### #### ####[]
Another great place to take out-of-towners !#### #### ####[]
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
We were very disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Nothing against a good sales call , but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious .#### #### ####[]
The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth 's is the Strip House .#### #### ####[]
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now , its official !#### #### ####[]
THe perfect spot .#### #### ####[]
I definitely will go back .#### #### ####[]
At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES .#### #### ####[]
Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York .#### #### ####[]
I have never had anything like it !#### #### ####[]
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !#### #### ####[]
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .#### #### ####[]
Not a great place for family or general dining .#### #### ####[]
My entire family was horrified .#### #### ####[]
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone .#### #### ####[]
We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like .#### #### ####[]
Okay , so I never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it 's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown .#### #### ####[]
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady .#### #### ####[]
Recommendations , of course , are required !#### #### ####[]
it 's delicious !#### #### ####[]
THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO !#### #### ####[]
You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation .#### #### ####[]
This place was not ALL THAT !#### #### ####[]
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited .#### #### ####[]
It is thick and slightly soggy .#### #### ####[]
I went here in the afternoon with a friend .#### #### ####[]
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !#### #### ####[]
I absolutely Loved this place .#### #### ####[]
This was a great surprise .#### #### ####[]
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .#### #### ####[]
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !#### #### ####[]
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !#### #### ####[]
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .#### #### ####[]
This place is great .#### #### ####[]
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .#### #### ####[]
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .#### #### ####[]
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant !#### #### ####[]
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .#### #### ####[]
Romantic if you want it to be ( brightly lit ) .#### #### ####[]
Filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable .#### #### ####[]
Ahhh ...#### #### ####[]
This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv .#### #### ####[]
I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons .#### #### ####[]
Terrible experience .#### #### ####[]
It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .#### #### ####[]
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE .#### #### ####[]
I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Tasty but expensive .#### #### ####[]
I 'd definitely recommend this little place .#### #### ####[]
I 've never been disappointed .#### #### ####[]
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out .#### #### ####[]
Will not be back .#### #### ####[]
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .#### #### ####[]
We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than Roth 's we are always disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .#### #### ####[]
You 'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .#### #### ####[]
I recommend it !#### #### ####[]
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out .#### #### ####[]
I am bringing my whole family back next time .#### #### ####[]
It 's very spicy but not offensive .#### #### ####[]
Just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .#### #### ####[]
Kudos to Po !#### #### ####[]
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City .#### #### ####[]
I can not recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself .#### #### ####[]
If just to drop in , quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over .#### #### ####[]
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza .#### #### ####[]
Really .#### #### ####[]
So close , but not good enough .#### #### ####[]
All I can say is WOW !#### #### ####[]
Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central .#### #### ####[]
For Park avenue I expected so much more .#### #### ####[]
Anyway , this is the last time I cross the williamsburg .#### #### ####[]
Rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special .#### #### ####[]
This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .#### #### ####[]
We come from New Jersey to eat at Kinoko .#### #### ####[]
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .#### #### ####[]
and i have been around the block , to say the very least .#### #### ####[]
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC .#### #### ####[]
Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years .#### #### ####[]
The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair .#### #### ####[]
It 's convenient .#### #### ####[]
This is the best thing in Soho .#### #### ####[]
We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied .#### #### ####[]
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune ?#### #### ####[]
JUST AWSOME .#### #### ####[]
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .#### #### ####[]
I was pleasantly suprised .#### #### ####[]
- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious ) .#### #### ####[]
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full .#### #### ####[]
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .#### #### ####[]
.the best I 've found outside of the Chinatown masters .#### #### ####[]
When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's .#### #### ####[]
Again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here .#### #### ####[]
please do n't fool us .#### #### ####[]
for Meetball Night .#### #### ####[]
Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed .#### #### ####[]
For an untrendy rip-off- eat here .#### #### ####[]
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .#### #### ####[]
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .#### #### ####[]
I will be returning .#### #### ####[]
If you like Sakagura but you feel it 's too much , you 'd better try Yokocho .#### #### ####[]
I live on the street this place is on .#### #### ####[]
I love going there !#### #### ####[]
It is terrific , as is the value .#### #### ####[]
I had a great experience .#### #### ####[]
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best .#### #### ####[]
It 's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night .#### #### ####[]
Will absolutely visit again .#### #### ####[]
we love th pink pony .#### #### ####[]
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place ( PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES ) .#### #### ####[]
All pretty good .#### #### ####[]
Will never be back .#### #### ####[]
I think the restaurant was too loud ( when full ) to be romantic .#### #### ####[]
They treat me like family , morning and night .#### #### ####[]
Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment .#### #### ####[]
And cheap !#### #### ####[]
To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .#### #### ####[]
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !#### #### ####[]
I absolutely love this place ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .#### #### ####[]
I never had anything I did n't like here .#### #### ####[]
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you !#### #### ####[]
I agree .#### #### ####[]
It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC .#### #### ####[]
I am completely hooked on this place , it is ridiculous .#### #### ####[]
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning .#### #### ####[]
In any event , even though its a bit on the pricey side , we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back .#### #### ####[]
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .#### #### ####[]
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .#### #### ####[]
Stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds ( hint hint ) .#### #### ####[]
It just was n't Thai .#### #### ####[]
My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com ,#### #### ####[]
They are amazing !#### #### ####[]
We just ate at Kai and were disapointed .#### #### ####[]
This restaurant is such a great place .#### #### ####[]
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth 's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites .#### #### ####[]
Bring your appetites .#### #### ####[]
Kudos Haru#### #### ####[]
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about .#### #### ####[]
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary .#### #### ####[]
during happy hour !#### #### ####[]
On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .#### #### ####[]
Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .#### #### ####[]
Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side .#### #### ####[]
you guys rock .#### #### ####[]
despite the untasteful previous review ...#### #### ####[]
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !#### #### ####[]
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .#### #### ####[]
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .#### #### ####[]
Ok , for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC , we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants , most of which stay open very late .#### #### ####[]
Go hungry and enjoy .#### #### ####[]
Went with mommy ( the only person who could afford taking me here ) .#### #### ####[]
Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .#### #### ####[]
Cute and decorative .#### #### ####[]
Do n't go .#### #### ####[]
Oh right , I should probably say something nice .#### #### ####[]
Excellent experience .#### #### ####[]
I 'm from England , and Haru 's was the best I had in NYC .#### #### ####[]
This is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both A-listers and people walking in off the street .#### #### ####[]
Highly Highly Highly recommended !#### #### ####[]
Faan is sooo good .#### #### ####[]
Never fails to please .#### #### ####[]
If you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .#### #### ####[]
Definately check it out ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Nice place though .#### #### ####[]
OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT .#### #### ####[]
He always says , I do n't have customers .#### #### ####[]
go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !#### #### ####[]
Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe 's to eat here .#### #### ####[]
We all felt it was worth it .#### #### ####[]
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .#### #### ####[]
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .#### #### ####[]
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .#### #### ####[]
Definitely will be back !#### #### ####[]
When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years .#### #### ####[]
Guess the 555Soul ads did n't launch her big modeling career .#### #### ####[]
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .#### #### ####[]
If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .#### #### ####[]
David , Daytona Beach , FL#### #### ####[]
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts .#### #### ####[]
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores .#### #### ####[]
Overall , excellent restaurant !#### #### ####[]
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .#### #### ####[]
I was very disappointed with this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
What a ripoff !#### #### ####[]
This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .#### #### ####[]
This was one of the BEST restaurants I 've ever been to .#### #### ####[]
I 'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much .#### #### ####[]
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row .#### #### ####[]
Pricey , but worth a try , at least once .#### #### ####[]
Overall a worthwhile experience .#### #### ####[]
Needless to say , I 'm never going back and you should be wary too .#### #### ####[]
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .#### #### ####[]
For asian fusion , there are many places further downtown .#### #### ####[]
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .#### #### ####[]
and we were thouroughly disapointed .#### #### ####[]
This restaurant is not worth the time , effort , or money to say the least .#### #### ####[]
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .#### #### ####[]
Everyone I bring here always loves it .#### #### ####[]
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .#### #### ####[]
We were not disappointed .#### #### ####[]
It 's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street .#### #### ####[]
delicious .#### #### ####[]
I 'll be back soon .#### #### ####[]
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .#### #### ####[]
But that is highly forgivable .#### #### ####[]
Interior was so so .#### #### ####[]
No apologies during restaurant week .#### #### ####[]
We were n't !#### #### ####[]
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date .#### #### ####[]
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .#### #### ####[]
I went to Ruby Foo 's after work with a group of 6 .#### #### ####[]
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !#### #### ####[]
I really liked this place .#### #### ####[]
You 'll adore it .#### #### ####[]
Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10:15 .#### #### ####[]
If you live outside the neighborhood , do n't bother !#### #### ####[]
but I would n't wan na live there .#### #### ####[]
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .#### #### ####[]
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .#### #### ####[]
I lOVE THIS PLACE !#### #### ####[]
great experience overall .#### #### ####[]
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend .#### #### ####[]
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .#### #### ####[]
I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion !#### #### ####[]
We 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .#### #### ####[]
really depends on your luck !#### #### ####[]
( or sister , in my case ! ) .#### #### ####[]
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !#### #### ####[]
This place is always packed .#### #### ####[]
And it was quick which is very important .#### #### ####[]
Amazing !#### #### ####[]
Not cheap , but not that expensive either .#### #### ####[]
Off the beaten path , this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants .#### #### ####[]
I am going to the mid town location next .#### #### ####[]
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get .#### #### ####[]
I would go back tho .#### #### ####[]
You will not be disapointed at all .#### #### ####[]
I for one will never patronize them again .#### #### ####[]
enough said !#### #### ####[]
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig !#### #### ####[]
We will go back every time we are in the City .#### #### ####[]
Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time .#### #### ####[]
This is probably one of my new favorite places .#### #### ####[]
Brava La Pizza Fresca !#### #### ####[]
It could have been handled better .#### #### ####[]
Do n't go there !#### #### ####[]
first it took us a long time to find the place .#### #### ####[]
I 've been several times and am totally smitten .#### #### ####[]
Great people watching as others do the same to you .#### #### ####[]
Everything is delicious , though , my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted !#### #### ####[]
From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .#### #### ####[]
And affordable .#### #### ####[]
It 's true , this place is not cheap .#### #### ####[]
Some of the finest latin women you 'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy 's .#### #### ####[]
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area .#### #### ####[]
A guaranteeed delight !#### #### ####[]
We were pleasantly surprised .#### #### ####[]
And I could do without the cigar smoke .#### #### ####[]
You ca n't go wrong here .#### #### ####[]
We 'd go back again#### #### ####[]
It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too .#### #### ####[]
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .#### #### ####[]
I 've been to Joya twice and I will never go again .#### #### ####[]
Worth a visit .#### #### ####[]
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge .#### #### ####[]
I loved it and would go again .#### #### ####[]
Is just the way it was in days gone by .#### #### ####[]
Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in .#### #### ####[]
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street .#### #### ####[]
I went to pams with my girlfriend , and i love it .#### #### ####[]
Went inside and I started to get excited .#### #### ####[]
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros .#### #### ####[]
GO HERE .#### #### ####[]
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .#### #### ####[]
A little noise but I think that was because of our party !#### #### ####[]
A hearty two thumbs up !#### #### ####[]
What a great place !#### #### ####[]
I am French and I really felt like home ! ! !#### #### ####[]
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone 's living room .#### #### ####[]
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .#### #### ####[]
Definitely a neighborhood favorite .#### #### ####[]
Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave .#### #### ####[]
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .#### #### ####[]
Aside from the bearded , courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he 's sleeping with that week , you see a strange mix of hipsters , frat boys , Will Smith types who need to be told they are black , bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet ... .#### #### ####[]
this one is definintely my least favorite .#### #### ####[]
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave .#### #### ####[]
Do n't waste your time , or money ! !#### #### ####[]
I will definetly be going back .#### #### ####[]
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .#### #### ####[]
A great addition to Smith Street : finally , a place that 's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots .#### #### ####[]
I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine , and have been going back regularly ever since .#### #### ####[]
No plans to return anytime soon .#### #### ####[]
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .#### #### ####[]
This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right .#### #### ####[]
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .#### #### ####[]
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place ( he painted the ballato 's sign in the window ) .#### #### ####[]
Like others have said , do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes , a busy restaurant may require you to wait .#### #### ####[]
I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city .#### #### ####[]
-- Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons#### #### ####[]
That said , I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I 've EVER had .#### #### ####[]
Go here .#### #### ####[]
What more can you ask for ?#### #### ####[]
I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC .#### #### ####[]
Tends to turn people away .#### #### ####[]
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .#### #### ####[]
I have n't been to the other locations .#### #### ####[]
Very different than regular dimsum places .#### #### ####[]
Then , IF they answer the phone , you 're lucky if they do n't hang up on you !#### #### ####[]
Alone for 100 bucks , it is really overprice .#### #### ####[]
This is also where I was from .#### #### ####[]
I think locals rate this place so high .#### #### ####[]
All of it was simply amazing , unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank .#### #### ####[]
I love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience .#### #### ####[]
It is expensive but well worth the money .#### #### ####[]
That 's why you have to pay more for that .#### #### ####[]
I HATE HATE HATE this place .#### #### ####[]
but overall i give it a 10#### #### ####[]
always fresh and delicious .#### #### ####[]
Not worth it .#### #### ####[]
Less = More in their case .#### #### ####[]
Also they were $ 15 each !#### #### ####[]
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...#### #### ####[]
I have been twice to this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !#### #### ####[]
it helps if you know what to order .#### #### ####[]
( Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .#### #### ####[]
It was a very nice surprise .#### #### ####[]
Once you become a regular , you are treated as one .#### #### ####[]
Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago .#### #### ####[]
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .#### #### ####[]
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .#### #### ####[]
Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently .#### #### ####[]
It was huge , delicious , fresh , and will be the reason we return .#### #### ####[]
We spent $ 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip .#### #### ####[]
You guys are awesome !#### #### ####[]
None of that yucky whipped stuff .#### #### ####[]
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings !#### #### ####[]
Well worth the trip , close to City Hall and downtown subway stops .#### #### ####[]
I 've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed .#### #### ####[]
I would definitely recommend Mary 's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts .#### #### ####[]
wow ! how have i missed this one , tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew .#### #### ####[]
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .#### #### ####[]
IT WAS HORRIBLE .#### #### ####[]
But too far east !#### #### ####[]
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family .#### #### ####[]
This place is so much fun .#### #### ####[]
If you were there when it first opened , give this restaurant a second chance .#### #### ####[]
Three strikes and this restaurant is out .#### #### ####[]
Definitely Highly NOT recommended .#### #### ####[]
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .#### #### ####[]
Murray wo n't do it .#### #### ####[]
I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .#### #### ####[]
I would go back .#### #### ####[]
If you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what Rao 's is all about .#### #### ####[]
We will be back .#### #### ####[]
Sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly .#### #### ####[]
Wonderful at holiday time .#### #### ####[]
This is where the aforementioned line was .#### #### ####[]
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone .#### #### ####[]
But they do .#### #### ####[]
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .#### #### ####[]
This is n't a value joint .#### #### ####[]
All in all , I do n't see how you can go wrong .#### #### ####[]
Going to Ballato 's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen , an absolute delight !#### #### ####[]
I thought this place was totally overrated .#### #### ####[]
Avoid at all costs .#### #### ####[]
Always busy but fast moving .#### #### ####[]
Besides , we were on vacation !#### #### ####[]
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .#### #### ####[]
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !#### #### ####[]
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .#### #### ####[]
A big disappointment , all around .#### #### ####[]
Everything about this restaurant was special .#### #### ####[]
I take all my NYC guests to VT 's .#### #### ####[]
A defitely must visit .#### #### ####[]
Based on the reviews on here , it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM .#### #### ####[]
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers .#### #### ####[]
Looking from the outside in , one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall ( really , that 's what it is ) .#### #### ####[]
i dont how this place is still running .#### #### ####[]
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they 're doing .#### #### ####[]
But , hey , there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria .#### #### ####[]
You can do it here .#### #### ####[]
We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past .#### #### ####[]
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .#### #### ####[]
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't wait to go back .#### #### ####[]
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results .#### #### ####[]
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited .#### #### ####[]
Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .#### #### ####[]
Stay far away from this place .#### #### ####[]
It 's to die for !#### #### ####[]
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT .#### #### ####[]
Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .#### #### ####[]
This is one of our all-time favorite .#### #### ####[]
Went to Village last night for my birthday .#### #### ####[]
Suan has challenged this loyalty .#### #### ####[]
I only have friends .#### #### ####[]
It is not worth for that bucks .#### #### ####[]
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY .#### #### ####[]
Big thumbs up !#### #### ####[]
keep up the good work .#### #### ####[]
This is the Cheers of New York , whether you 've ever been there or not .#### #### ####[]
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .#### #### ####[]
A pleasant surprise .#### #### ####[]
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf ( ok bad joke ) , but you will see .#### #### ####[]
But I 'd go back#### #### ####[]
I hate this .#### #### ####[]
I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one .#### #### ####[]
Beautiful experience .#### #### ####[]
Too bad Latin Quarters closed .#### #### ####[]
Somewhat pricey but what the heck .#### #### ####[]
I 'll keep this short .#### #### ####[]
If you do n't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House .#### #### ####[]
This place is to be avoided .#### #### ####[]
I love this place more and more everytime i go .#### #### ####[]
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here .#### #### ####[]
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat .#### #### ####[]
If that 's a problem , go to McDonald 's and destroy your insides .#### #### ####[]
It 's a really great deal , considering we got full off of four dollars .#### #### ####[]
Do n't look down your nose at me like that ...#### #### ####[]
I just do n't understand all the hype ...#### #### ####[]
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite .#### #### ####[]
I 'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .#### #### ####[]
While I 'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business !#### #### ####[]
I would definently recommend this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .#### #### ####[]
Something about them being busy with holiday party 's .#### #### ####[]
Definitely not a restaurant to skip !#### #### ####[]
They never came back to refill our glasses again .#### #### ####[]
That 's good and bad .#### #### ####[]
Rosario 's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence .#### #### ####[]
If you are a carnivore , come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been .#### #### ####[]
Was there Friday night .#### #### ####[]
A million better places to go in the city .#### #### ####[]
They also do a great job for restaurant week .#### #### ####[]
I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli .#### #### ####[]
Restaurant was dirty and unkempt .#### #### ####[]
I would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again .#### #### ####[]
It was wonderful .#### #### ####[]
I am Indian , and I have tried many Indian places in NY .#### #### ####[]
So eat fast and order a lot .#### #### ####[]
PERFECT FOR DATES !#### #### ####[]
so garantuan that you ca n't fit them in a toaster .#### #### ####[]
I 've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants .#### #### ####[]
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .#### #### ####[]
Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
This restaurant was way overhyped .#### #### ####[]
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES .#### #### ####[]
They 're terrific ! !#### #### ####[]
and there 's no way out .#### #### ####[]
We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got .#### #### ####[]
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .#### #### ####[]
for my birthday and we had an excellent time .#### #### ####[]
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .#### #### ####[]
When you enter , you feel like you have entered your mom 's kitchen .#### #### ####[]
I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .#### #### ####[]
He ca n't help , they 're bought up so fast .#### #### ####[]
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .#### #### ####[]
I highly recommend it .#### #### ####[]
This restaurant used to be pretty decent .#### #### ####[]
Fantastic place .#### #### ####[]
We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .#### #### ####[]
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .#### #### ####[]
Having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot .#### #### ####[]
Go for it !#### #### ####[]
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .#### #### ####[]
Unbelievable .#### #### ####[]
This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .#### #### ####[]
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .#### #### ####[]
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back , in a veyr good sense .#### #### ####[]
Worth the trip from Manhattan .#### #### ####[]
The place does get crowded , so I recommend going between 4-5 PM .#### #### ####[]
if your into thai..you can not miss this great restaurant .#### #### ####[]
We were very pleasantly surprised .#### #### ####[]
I would highly recommend it .#### #### ####[]
Want to impress ?#### #### ####[]
Horrible .#### #### ####[]
It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
However , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par .#### #### ####[]
We had a good time .#### #### ####[]
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .#### #### ####[]
Boy was I wrong !#### #### ####[]
Now at the top of our list , Del Frisco 's Steakhouse .#### #### ####[]
Plenty of choices to make your own creation .#### #### ####[]
In China the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud .#### #### ####[]
I go twice a month !#### #### ####[]
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .#### #### ####[]
I love it .#### #### ####[]
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .#### #### ####[]
I love the place .#### #### ####[]
And all of that wo n't break your bank !#### #### ####[]
For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves .#### #### ####[]
Try it side by side and there 's no comparison .#### #### ####[]
Very good value#### #### ####[]
I would not recommend this place to anyone .#### #### ####[]
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .#### #### ####[]
Finally !#### #### ####[]
Bon appettite ! !#### #### ####[]
Me and my girls will definitely go back .#### #### ####[]
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho .#### #### ####[]
To speak of the Park Side , words can not describe .#### #### ####[]
When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside , she recommended that we go to this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
i would go again if i did n't have to pay .#### #### ####[]
You will find yourself returning quite often .#### #### ####[]
However , it 's not worth a special trip .#### #### ####[]
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .#### #### ####[]
How do you rate home ?#### #### ####[]
I went there with my friend last saturday .#### #### ####[]
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .#### #### ####[]
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village .#### #### ####[]
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .#### #### ####[]
We bring in a party of ten or so every week .#### #### ####[]
I heartily recommend .#### #### ####[]
In any event , this is a place I 'll be sure to stop by again when I 'm in this part of town .#### #### ####[]
Being from the south , there are n't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz 's Deli .#### #### ####[]
Obviously run by folks who know a pie .#### #### ####[]
I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy 's Bronx , or for that matter , Jimmy 's Uptown , again .#### #### ####[]
Jimmy is Dominican !#### #### ####[]
Would NEVER go back there .#### #### ####[]
Searching to get out from the cold , freezing weather , we went into what we thought was a deli .#### #### ####[]
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .#### #### ####[]
Thank You Emilio .#### #### ####[]
Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends .#### #### ####[]
But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going .#### #### ####[]
Our friends have not arrived yet .#### #### ####[]
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .#### #### ####[]
It 's a steal !#### #### ####[]
It 's usually packed for good reason , esp .#### #### ####[]
One of my favorite places in Manhattan .#### #### ####[]
it is not consistent .#### #### ####[]
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned .#### #### ####[]
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .#### #### ####[]
We will definitely go back .#### #### ####[]
Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe .#### #### ####[]
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .#### #### ####[]
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .#### #### ####[]
Not only would I not recommend Jimmy 's restaurants to friends , I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but .#### #### ####[]
I 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud .#### #### ####[]
Please save yourself the frustration .#### #### ####[]
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .#### #### ####[]
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .#### #### ####[]
So , if yo really do n't care who is sittingnext to you , which is about 2 inches away , I would say try it .#### #### ####[]
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .#### #### ####[]
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you , or with the local union worker on the other side .#### #### ####[]
For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .#### #### ####[]
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs , so be aware .#### #### ####[]
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it !#### #### ####[]
I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return .#### #### ####[]
For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion , I do prefer smaller , quiter restaurants .#### #### ####[]
Now it 's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you .#### #### ####[]
ALWAYS full with tourists ( especially because of it 's close proximity to Rockefeller Center ) .#### #### ####[]
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car ( I happen to live in Inwood ) .#### #### ####[]
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .#### #### ####[]
I 'm saving up for my next visit .#### #### ####[]
Just ignore the trendy wannabes .#### #### ####[]
Even my Indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .#### #### ####[]
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .#### #### ####[]
Great neighborhood joint .#### #### ####[]
Fantastic !#### #### ####[]
I would highly recommend this place !#### #### ####[]
A real dissapointment .#### #### ####[]
Love YUKA .#### #### ####[]
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening , I do n't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area .#### #### ####[]
And I 've been to many NYC delis .#### #### ####[]
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .#### #### ####[]
This time , I prefer not to go into detail .#### #### ####[]
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .#### #### ####[]
You are treated just like royality .#### #### ####[]
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort .#### #### ####[]
I will go back to Suan soon !#### #### ####[]
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .#### #### ####[]
Go , go , hurry , before everyone finds out about it .#### #### ####[]
Went there last night for 2 year anniversery , and was n't all that impressed .#### #### ####[]
This place is cool enough to be in the East Village , but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris .#### #### ####[]
I will have to say , this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite .#### #### ####[]
Even though it is a little loud , you do n't have to yell at each other to talk .#### #### ####[]
Amma is nothing special .#### #### ####[]
Loved it !#### #### ####[]
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location !#### #### ####[]
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
If only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !#### #### ####[]
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day .#### #### ####[]
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .#### #### ####[]
Just do n't do it .#### #### ####[]
Please be aware that it 's CASH or AMEX only !#### #### ####[]
I 've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens .#### #### ####[]
I wish they would change back to what it was before .#### #### ####[]
You will be satisfied .#### #### ####[]
It is simply amazing .#### #### ####[]
However , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street .#### #### ####[]
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .#### #### ####[]
Love Pizza 33..#### #### ####[]
highly recommended .#### #### ####[]
by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback ! !#### #### ####[]
Trust me , it will be great , and all of it will be devoured in no time .#### #### ####[]
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .#### #### ####[]
They are FAST .#### #### ####[]
We go often .#### #### ####[]
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .#### #### ####[]
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday .#### #### ####[]
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged .#### #### ####[]
I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently .#### #### ####[]
I pray it stays open forever .#### #### ####[]
One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown .#### #### ####[]
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular .#### #### ####[]
This is , by far , my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often !#### #### ####[]
This is my fourth try over a two year period , and I 'm done .#### #### ####[]
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .#### #### ####[]
We were then shooed inside .#### #### ####[]
You wo n't find that anywhere in Manhattan .#### #### ####[]
My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed .#### #### ####[]
Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and do n't want to bother going farther for a better place .#### #### ####[]
One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason .#### #### ####[]
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .#### #### ####[]
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .#### #### ####[]
No thanks ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I definitely would n't go back .#### #### ####[]
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience .#### #### ####[]
We left , never to return .#### #### ####[]
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .#### #### ####[]
I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .#### #### ####[]
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .#### #### ####[]
This was on a Tuesday night .#### #### ####[]
After the review I treked into Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
Enjoy ! ! !#### #### ####[]
That place was awesome , , , sally !#### #### ####[]
We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments .#### #### ####[]
Satisfying .#### #### ####[]
Everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once .#### #### ####[]
There was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at Pastis .#### #### ####[]
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it .#### #### ####[]
My six year old loved it .#### #### ####[]
we spent 50 $ $ definetly will come back with my friends ! ! !#### #### ####[]
When we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong .#### #### ####[]
If you want to save some money , do n't go here .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommended .#### #### ####[]
I 've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .#### #### ####[]
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G . again last night .#### #### ####[]
Yeah , it 's that good .#### #### ####[]
It was pretty inexpensive too .#### #### ####[]
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place ( the first being Joya ) .#### #### ####[]
What a great place .#### #### ####[]
So sorry I ca n't rate this better .#### #### ####[]
Wonderful !#### #### ####[]
To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside , its so bland on the inside .#### #### ####[]
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls ' night .#### #### ####[]
so i thought why not change it up a bit .#### #### ####[]
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .#### #### ####[]
When we arrived at 6:00 PM , the restaurant was practically empty .#### #### ####[]
It 's really a takeaway place , I would n't sit if I could take it home .#### #### ####[]
I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well .#### #### ####[]
This place is a great bargain .#### #### ####[]
I know this is the case in many nyc eateries , but here , they really cram you in to the point where it 's borderline uncomfortable .#### #### ####[]
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore .#### #### ####[]
This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai ( another delicious Thai restaurant ) .#### #### ####[]
Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones .#### #### ####[]
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .#### #### ####[]
But WARNING : to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations .#### #### ####[]
( La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico ) .#### #### ####[]
Maybe tomorrow ; - )#### #### ####[]
Do n't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo .#### #### ####[]
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .#### #### ####[]
So , again , give it a try .#### #### ####[]
When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .#### #### ####[]
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .#### #### ####[]
Not pretentious and very economical .#### #### ####[]
We would return to this place again !#### #### ####[]
I ca n't wait for the nex time .#### #### ####[]
Worth it for a special occasion , or any time !#### #### ####[]
It is LOUD , HOT and DARK .#### #### ####[]
Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays !#### #### ####[]
It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed !#### #### ####[]
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris .#### #### ####[]
I was there on sat .#### #### ####[]
At 6:30 , we were the third party there .#### #### ####[]
they live up to the thai way of living .#### #### ####[]
Just wish they 'd expand .#### #### ####[]
For $ 600 ( the most we have ever paid ) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance .#### #### ####[]
Hurley 's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came .#### #### ####[]
They all know you .#### #### ####[]
We got most of it back at home with us .#### #### ####[]
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !#### #### ####[]
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment .#### #### ####[]
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
On a recent Saturday night , I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar .#### #### ####[]
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .#### #### ####[]
Katz 's has been a NYC original for over 100 years .#### #### ####[]
Authentic bistro !#### #### ####[]
Based on a visit a month ago , I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .#### #### ####[]
Katz 's deli is a great NY experience .#### #### ####[]
Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic ...#### #### ####[]
this place is amazingly bad .#### #### ####[]
Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy .#### #### ####[]
We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .#### #### ####[]
hmmm .#### #### ####[]
I know because I live nearby .#### #### ####[]
I love this cozy around the way Rest .#### #### ####[]
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30 .#### #### ####[]
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .#### #### ####[]
Overall , worht every penny .#### #### ####[]
Great idea and base for restaurant , but work on the details , people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like .#### #### ####[]
Go inside and you wo n't want to leave .#### #### ####[]
I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening .#### #### ####[]
Also very inexpensive .#### #### ####[]
I 've always been seated propmtly .#### #### ####[]
Everytime my husband and I go there , we are never disappointed .#### #### ####[]
Look elsewhere .#### #### ####[]
Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .#### #### ####[]
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers , right off of Pell St ( barber 's alley ) in Chinatown .#### #### ####[]
wont come back again for sure !#### #### ####[]
Get there before 7pm .#### #### ####[]
You can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .#### #### ####[]
get over it !#### #### ####[]
Ruby Foo 's is a tourist trap .#### #### ####[]
Go girls ! ! !#### #### ####[]
So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave .#### #### ####[]
I loved this place ! !#### #### ####[]
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .#### #### ####[]
To give you an idea of how good we thought it was , we ended up going to Ping 's three weekends in a row ! ! !#### #### ####[]
A one women show !#### #### ####[]
I am a die hard peep lover .#### #### ####[]
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .#### #### ####[]
Walk-ins are risky too .#### #### ####[]
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .#### #### ####[]
It was divine melts in your mouth .#### #### ####[]
I got enough reasons to keep coming back ! ! !#### #### ####[]
When we left at 8:00 PM , it was packed and noisy .#### #### ####[]

I loved it .#### #### ####[]
In fact , you ca n't miss it .#### #### ####[]
I was at Rao 's last Wed .#### #### ####[]
There is nothing more pleasant than that .#### #### ####[]
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table .#### #### ####[]
I would n't mind going back some time , but not before trying others nearby .#### #### ####[]
I went to Amma after a friend recommended it .#### #### ####[]
It 's true , you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas .#### #### ####[]
Very neighborhoody , very quick and sufficient .#### #### ####[]
but still my date was bad#### #### ####[]
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .#### #### ####[]
For being number 1 , this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation .#### #### ####[]
I will be going back and heartily recommend it !#### #### ####[]
Take a good sense of humor , an American express card with no limit , walk out with a lollipop , gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road#### #### ####[]
Bravissimo ! !#### #### ####[]
I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more !#### #### ####[]
I do n't think I would go again .#### #### ####[]
Check it out#### #### ####[]
( I 've ordered from the 2nd ave .#### #### ####[]
I 've been there a few times , and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people .#### #### ####[]
This place is worth an one-hour drive .#### #### ####[]
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple .#### #### ####[]
Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table .#### #### ####[]
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .#### #### ####[]
Went last Thursday .#### #### ####[]
Chance is a joke .#### #### ####[]
Great find ! ! !#### #### ####[]
And you 're hungry a few hours later .#### #### ####[]
Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan , I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray 's .#### #### ####[]

My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary .#### #### ####[]
I 've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I 've never been disappointed .#### #### ####[]
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently .#### #### ####[]

We went to Ino for Valentines .#### #### ####[]
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
As a Japanese native , I 've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place .#### #### ####[]
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .#### #### ####[]
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .#### #### ####[]
Hurley 's is terrific !#### #### ####[]
The place is a lot of fun .#### #### ####[]
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .#### #### ####[]
Recommended .#### #### ####[]
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .#### #### ####[]
I wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday .#### #### ####[]
However , I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
I do n't get it , what 's so special about Prune ?#### #### ####[]
One less manhattanite the better .#### #### ####[]
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .#### #### ####[]
