I am going to the mid town location next .#### #### ####[]
I 've waited over one hour for food .#### #### ####[]
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !#### #### ####[]
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A .#### #### ####[]
Never fails to please .#### #### ####[]
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .#### #### ####[]
It does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .#### #### ####[]
We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .#### #### ####[]
Inexpensive , unassuming , great time !#### #### ####[]
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular .#### #### ####[]
Really , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .#### #### ####[]
Very , very nice#### #### ####[]
I 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( I live on UWS ) .#### #### ####[]
I look forward to eating here again#### #### ####[]
It 's to die for !#### #### ####[]
I 'd definitely go back again .#### #### ####[]
I would highly recommend it .#### #### ####[]
Wow .#### #### ####[]
What more can you ask for ?#### #### ####[]
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .#### #### ####[]
Dumbfoundingly Poor#### #### ####[]
We live nearby BFC .#### #### ####[]
It 's cuz it 's so good you need to taste it ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !#### #### ####[]
At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .#### #### ####[]
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .#### #### ####[]
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
The prices are wonderfully low .#### #### ####[]
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .#### #### ####[]
Restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .#### #### ####[]
It is simply amazing .#### #### ####[]
Expensive#### #### ####[]
You will find yourself returning quite often .#### #### ####[]
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .#### #### ####[]
We 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .#### #### ####[]
Of course , it is crowded but who cares .#### #### ####[]
too large for just two people but nothing was left .#### #### ####[]
Just ignore the trendy wannabes .#### #### ####[]
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .#### #### ####[]
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night .#### #### ####[]

I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently .#### #### ####[]
I go here at least once every other week , particularly when it 's cold !#### #### ####[]
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .#### #### ####[]
So close , but not good enough .#### #### ####[]
I 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .#### #### ####[]
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .#### #### ####[]
Our teenage kids love it , too .#### #### ####[]
I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .#### #### ####[]
Probably would not go again ...#### #### ####[]
Okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .#### #### ####[]
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .#### #### ####[]
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .#### #### ####[]
The food arrived in about 15 minutes .#### #### ####[]
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME ! ! !#### #### ####[]
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !#### #### ####[]
I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .#### #### ####[]
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .#### #### ####[]
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .#### #### ####[]
Sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive .#### #### ####[]
I definitely would n't go back .#### #### ####[]
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .#### #### ####[]
A classic !#### #### ####[]
To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .#### #### ####[]
It was wonderful .#### #### ####[]
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...#### #### ####[]
If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .#### #### ####[]
What a hassle !#### #### ####[]
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend .#### #### ####[]
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .#### #### ####[]
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .#### #### ####[]
Not worth it .#### #### ####[]
In fact there is only one I 've tried that even compares ( shabu Tatsu ) and even then I prefer Dokebi .#### #### ####[]
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !#### #### ####[]
Yes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .#### #### ####[]
But $ 1 for each small piece ? ? ?#### #### ####[]
One of my favorite places in Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .#### #### ####[]
I wish I COULD be refunded !#### #### ####[]
It was well worth the wait .#### #### ####[]
I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night .#### #### ####[]
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .#### #### ####[]
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .#### #### ####[]
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .#### #### ####[]
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !#### #### ####[]
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho .#### #### ####[]
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .#### #### ####[]
Wonderful at holiday time .#### #### ####[]
I will be going back and heartily recommend it !#### #### ####[]
We all ordered different entrees so we could share .#### #### ####[]
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .#### #### ####[]
I think the stuff was better than Disney .#### #### ####[]
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly .#### #### ####[]
But too far east !#### #### ####[]
Well ... they can run but they ca n't hide .#### #### ####[]
JUST AWSOME .#### #### ####[]
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .#### #### ####[]
When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's .#### #### ####[]
Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .#### #### ####[]
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .#### #### ####[]
So eat fast and order a lot .#### #### ####[]
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .#### #### ####[]
You want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn ?#### #### ####[]
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .#### #### ####[]
Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !#### #### ####[]
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .#### #### ####[]
Appetizers took nearly an hour .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommended to all !#### #### ####[]
I lived on 50th st , and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out .#### #### ####[]
Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years , I am now in culinary school , I am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half Korean !#### #### ####[]
It 's popular w/the late crowd .#### #### ####[]
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation ( if possible )#### #### ####[]
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .#### #### ####[]
Over 100 different choices to create your own .#### #### ####[]
esp . during happy hour !#### #### ####[]
Much more reasonably priced too !#### #### ####[]
I have been twice to this restaurant .#### #### ####[]
really depends on your luck !#### #### ####[]
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .#### #### ####[]
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .#### #### ####[]
Go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ...#### #### ####[]
Are you freaking kidding me ?#### #### ####[]
I 'm not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself .#### #### ####[]
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .#### #### ####[]
I love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience .#### #### ####[]
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they do n't make you by bottles .#### #### ####[]
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .#### #### ####[]
One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten .#### #### ####[]
Moderate prices .#### #### ####[]
We called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .#### #### ####[]
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .#### #### ####[]
Fantastic !#### #### ####[]
So rude ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Why ?#### #### ####[]
I do not recommend .#### #### ####[]
There are so many other great places to go to eat and drink ... .. this place is not worth it ...#### #### ####[]
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .#### #### ####[]
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .#### #### ####[]
Very pleased#### #### ####[]
It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .#### #### ####[]
We asked for beverages and never received them .#### #### ####[]
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .#### #### ####[]
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .#### #### ####[]
Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .#### #### ####[]
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .#### #### ####[]
Will never be back .#### #### ####[]
( that is A MUST , but not every restaurant can do ... )#### #### ####[]
Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of bagels .#### #### ####[]
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .#### #### ####[]
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I lived in Maine for ten years and grew up on fish .#### #### ####[]
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .#### #### ####[]
Ciao Bella#### #### ####[]
Old school meets New world .#### #### ####[]
Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .#### #### ####[]
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .#### #### ####[]
I do n't think I would go again .#### #### ####[]
It 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .#### #### ####[]
But , they were too big for the bun .#### #### ####[]
I will be going back very soon .#### #### ####[]
Hurley 's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came .#### #### ####[]
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .#### #### ####[]
The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .#### #### ####[]
Another review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .#### #### ####[]
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .#### #### ####[]
( Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .#### #### ####[]
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .#### #### ####[]
There are other people waiting !#### #### ####[]
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !#### #### ####[]
We go often for lunch and the place is packed .#### #### ####[]
P.S . Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .#### #### ####[]
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .#### #### ####[]
We had Lava Cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it .#### #### ####[]
Just want to warn you all - do n't waste your time and money .#### #### ####[]
Fine , I wont hang you for that .#### #### ####[]
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .#### #### ####[]
Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else .#### #### ####[]
awesome#### #### ####[]
We were less than impressed .#### #### ####[]
Unbelievable .#### #### ####[]
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .#### #### ####[]
I will NEVER return .#### #### ####[]
A big disappointment , all around .#### #### ####[]
( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal .#### #### ####[]
I just do n't understand all the hype ...#### #### ####[]
Having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot .#### #### ####[]
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .#### #### ####[]
We 've tried before but it always packed and does n't take reservations .#### #### ####[]
It was pretty inexpensive too .#### #### ####[]
As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .#### #### ####[]
For a Fabulous Wedding !#### #### ####[]
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .#### #### ####[]
I wish they would change back to what it was before .#### #### ####[]
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .#### #### ####[]
Not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .#### #### ####[]
would NOT go back .#### #### ####[]
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .#### #### ####[]
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave .#### #### ####[]
well , i did n't find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience .#### #### ####[]
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy 's !#### #### ####[]
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .#### #### ####[]
I have eaten a lot of pizza here .#### #### ####[]
You can do it here .#### #### ####[]
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .#### #### ####[]
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .#### #### ####[]
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .#### #### ####[]
Also they were $ 15 each !#### #### ####[]
Its dark , and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommended !#### #### ####[]
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had ( except for my mom 's of course ) .#### #### ####[]
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service I need ...#### #### ####[]
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .#### #### ####[]
Never again !#### #### ####[]
But that is highly forgivable .#### #### ####[]
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?#### #### ####[]
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !#### #### ####[]
We left , never to return .#### #### ####[]
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .#### #### ####[]
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .#### #### ####[]
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm is n't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world , but it 's pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .#### #### ####[]
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .#### #### ####[]
I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far .#### #### ####[]
It is thick and slightly soggy .#### #### ####[]
All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .#### #### ####[]
We 've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .#### #### ####[]
Remind me of home .#### #### ####[]
Went for Mom 's birthday brunch/lunch .#### #### ####[]
Will comeback for sure , wish they have it here in LA..#### #### ####[]
We were very disappointed .#### #### ####[]
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
It is also extremely well priced .#### #### ####[]
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .#### #### ####[]
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .#### #### ####[]
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received !#### #### ####[]
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .#### #### ####[]
Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead .#### #### ####[]
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !#### #### ####[]
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .#### #### ####[]
Moving on .#### #### ####[]
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .#### #### ####[]
If you ware looking for Korean fusion , I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village .#### #### ####[]
I plan on stopping by next week as well .#### #### ####[]
A pleasant surprise .#### #### ####[]
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .#### #### ####[]
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .#### #### ####[]
There is `` Expensive-but-worth-it '' and there is `` Expensive-and-WTF '' ?#### #### ####[]
For those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n't get it .#### #### ####[]
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .#### #### ####[]
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else .#### #### ####[]
She just nodded and walked off .#### #### ####[]
When the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .#### #### ####[]
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave .#### #### ####[]
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .#### #### ####[]
Will give it another chance before I write it off .#### #### ####[]
Awesome#### #### ####[]
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .#### #### ####[]
However , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .#### #### ####[]
Entrees : Vanison steak and Bison Steak .#### #### ####[]
I live in the West Village and I 've been to a lot of restaurants .#### #### ####[]
I 'm saving up for my next visit .#### #### ####[]
I know because I live nearby .#### #### ####[]
Loved it !#### #### ####[]
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .#### #### ####[]
please do n't fool us .#### #### ####[]
It was divine melts in your mouth .#### #### ####[]
One of the best , if not THE best , restaurants in Park Slope ( and NY in general )#### #### ####[]
Too bad Latin Quarters closed .#### #### ####[]
When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly .#### #### ####[]
Please be aware that it 's CASH or AMEX only !#### #### ####[]
You 'll be ther for every anniversary , birthday , valentines day ...#### #### ####[]
Her review is above .#### #### ####[]
Went to Village last night for my birthday .#### #### ####[]
Which lets face it ... .at times it 's a good thing .#### #### ####[]
My friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .#### #### ####[]
Amazing !#### #### ####[]
over .#### #### ####[]
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .#### #### ####[]
DO not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .#### #### ####[]
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .#### #### ####[]
Was there Friday night .#### #### ####[]
Terrible Waste of money.. scammers#### #### ####[]
Overall , not worth the money .#### #### ####[]
Give it a try and enjoy .#### #### ####[]
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .#### #### ####[]
Maybe it has improved since then ?#### #### ####[]
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .#### #### ####[]
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .#### #### ####[]
I have been going back again and again .#### #### ####[]
Since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .#### #### ####[]
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .#### #### ####[]
In about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .#### #### ####[]
As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .#### #### ####[]
There are no negatives to speak of .#### #### ####[]
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .#### #### ####[]
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .#### #### ####[]
There were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect English .#### #### ####[]
If you want to dine with large party , I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT .#### #### ####[]
I ca n't wait to go back .#### #### ####[]
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !#### #### ####[]
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .#### #### ####[]
keep up the good work .#### #### ####[]
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently#### #### ####[]
We order a bit of everything on the menu .#### #### ####[]
Good Experience#### #### ####[]
I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .#### #### ####[]
We will go back every time we are in the City .#### #### ####[]
This is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .#### #### ####[]
Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !#### #### ####[]
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .#### #### ####[]
I grew up on these bagels .#### #### ####[]
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .#### #### ####[]
We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .#### #### ####[]
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .#### #### ####[]
enough said !#### #### ####[]
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious#### #### ####[]
Recommendations , of course , are required !#### #### ####[]
I come here enjoy very much with husband .#### #### ####[]
you should travel from the Bronx to try it ...#### #### ####[]
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .#### #### ####[]
She replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . ''#### #### ####[]
When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .#### #### ####[]
They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .#### #### ####[]
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .#### #### ####[]
Not cheap but very yummy .#### #### ####[]
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .#### #### ####[]
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .#### #### ####[]
I 've eaten at many different Indian restaurants .#### #### ####[]
we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes .#### #### ####[]
The hostess said `` Wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together '' , to which I replied `` no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . ''#### #### ####[]
LOL#### #### ####[]
Best In ALL of NYC#### #### ####[]
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently .#### #### ####[]
Its located in greenewich village .#### #### ####[]
I do n't get it either .#### #### ####[]
Also , they do not take credit card so come with cash !#### #### ####[]
What ?#### #### ####[]
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .#### #### ####[]
Being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .#### #### ####[]
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .#### #### ####[]
Keep up the good work guys !#### #### ####[]
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .#### #### ####[]
I was so stunned , and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .#### #### ####[]
I 've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .#### #### ####[]
We will be back .#### #### ####[]
We 'd go back again#### #### ####[]
highly recommended .#### #### ####[]
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .#### #### ####[]
We 've found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price .#### #### ####[]
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life .#### #### ####[]
IT WAS HORRIBLE .#### #### ####[]
I went here for a family birthday dinner .#### #### ####[]
For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .#### #### ####[]
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .#### #### ####[]
Creative , consistent , fresh .#### #### ####[]
My six year old loved it .#### #### ####[]
Too many other good places to have to settle .#### #### ####[]
When you add it all together , it just does n't seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices .#### #### ####[]
Priced at upper intermediate range .#### #### ####[]
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .#### #### ####[]
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .#### #### ####[]
I have eaten at some of the 'best ' sushi joints in NYC ( Nobu , Bond Street , JewelBako , etc ) and Yamato is my favorite .#### #### ####[]
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .#### #### ####[]
Also very inexpensive .#### #### ####[]
It 's also attached to Angel 's Share , which is a cool , more romantic bar ...#### #### ####[]
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .#### #### ####[]
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : Cassuolet , Steake Fritte , Tripe Stew , etc ; simple stuff .#### #### ####[]
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .#### #### ####[]
Ahhh ...#### #### ####[]
The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .#### #### ####[]
Me and my girls will definitely go back .#### #### ####[]
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .#### #### ####[]
Our experience did not ever get any better .#### #### ####[]
Once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you ca n't stop !#### #### ####[]
Maybe tomorrow ; - )#### #### ####[]
I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .#### #### ####[]
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .#### #### ####[]
Lives up to the hype#### #### ####[]
AMAZING MY FAVORITE ! ! !#### #### ####[]
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .#### #### ####[]
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .#### #### ####[]
Polite acknowledgement is out ;#### #### ####[]
I went there with my friend last saturday .#### #### ####[]
I sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes .#### #### ####[]
Overpriced and not tasty#### #### ####[]
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )#### #### ####[]
Ruth , mother of the Bride#### #### ####[]
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .#### #### ####[]
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .#### #### ####[]
Prices are in line .#### #### ####[]
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY -- I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .#### #### ####[]
it is not consistent .#### #### ####[]
Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .#### #### ####[]
$ 170 down the toilet ...#### #### ####[]
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .#### #### ####[]
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .#### #### ####[]
Stay away#### #### ####[]
Would n't recomend it for dinner !#### #### ####[]
Do n't go with a larger group than 4 !#### #### ####[]
great taste#### #### ####[]
and you ca n't beat the prices .#### #### ####[]
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner :#### #### ####[]
This was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .#### #### ####[]
Was surprisingly disappointed .#### #### ####[]
I honestly do n't even know where to begin .#### #### ####[]
No plans to return anytime soon .#### #### ####[]
They all know you .#### #### ####[]
Way below average#### #### ####[]
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .#### #### ####[]
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .#### #### ####[]
Then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .#### #### ####[]
Will not be back .#### #### ####[]
Would NEVER go back there .#### #### ####[]
Jimmy is Dominican !#### #### ####[]
Great , original taste .#### #### ####[]
Go here .#### #### ####[]
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .#### #### ####[]
No , really .#### #### ####[]
We will definitely go back .#### #### ####[]
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .#### #### ####[]
Great find in the West Village !#### #### ####[]
Need I say more ?#### #### ####[]
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .#### #### ####[]
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .#### #### ####[]
I went there 2times .#### #### ####[]
I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .#### #### ####[]
A little crowded but they move that line really fast !#### #### ####[]
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .#### #### ####[]
Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .#### #### ####[]
We were very pleasantly surprised .#### #### ####[]
And I 've been to many NYC delis .#### #### ####[]
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .#### #### ####[]
Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee .#### #### ####[]
Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .#### #### ####[]
It is so romantic .#### #### ####[]
it helps if you know what to order .#### #### ####[]
A must try !#### #### ####[]
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . (#### #### ####[]
And I hate to say this but I doubt I 'll ever go back .#### #### ####[]
peppers , onions , relish , chilli , cheeses , you NAME it .#### #### ####[]
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !#### #### ####[]
Fresh , mind blowing flavors .#### #### ####[]
From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .#### #### ####[]
One of the BEST#### #### ####[]
Probably would not go back here .#### #### ####[]
To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommend it !#### #### ####[]
It 's very spicy but not offensive .#### #### ####[]
Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave .#### #### ####[]
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .#### #### ####[]
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .#### #### ####[]
Nice for one time special occasion .#### #### ####[]
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .#### #### ####[]
Everyone must come here at least once .#### #### ####[]
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .#### #### ####[]
We were charged full price .#### #### ####[]
Worth the trip from Manhattan .#### #### ####[]
If you go here , do it on his off-night .#### #### ####[]
But they do .#### #### ####[]
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .#### #### ####[]
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .#### #### ####[]
Would NEVER go back#### #### ####[]
If you do n't like it , I do n't know what to tell you .#### #### ####[]
We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .#### #### ####[]
Good for dates or with friends .#### #### ####[]
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies .#### #### ####[]
I am bringing my whole family back next time .#### #### ####[]
My wife and I went to Water 's Edge for a romantic dinner .#### #### ####[]
My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .#### #### ####[]
My family ate here last weekend .#### #### ####[]
Prices are very good .#### #### ####[]
They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant .#### #### ####[]
Celebrated my fathers birthday here .#### #### ####[]
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .#### #### ####[]
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .#### #### ####[]
Skip Nathan 's ... you can get that at the mall ... go to Bark .#### #### ####[]
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .#### #### ####[]
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .#### #### ####[]
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .#### #### ####[]
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .#### #### ####[]
Everything we had was good or ok ... .but definitely nothing great .#### #### ####[]
Even my Indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .#### #### ####[]
It just was n't Thai .#### #### ####[]
Cute and decorative .#### #### ####[]
This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .#### #### ####[]
Nice value .#### #### ####[]
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .#### #### ####[]
We were n't !#### #### ####[]
Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .#### #### ####[]
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience .#### #### ####[]
I was there on sat . for my birthday and we had an excellent time .#### #### ####[]
This was a great surprise .#### #### ####[]
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .#### #### ####[]
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .#### #### ####[]
I mentioned the squid dish was n't very good when the waitress visited .#### #### ####[]
We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday , we sat in the tent .#### #### ####[]
My bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie .#### #### ####[]
I was pleasantly suprised .#### #### ####[]
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !#### #### ####[]
I went with JWILS .#### #### ####[]
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .#### #### ####[]
My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight .#### #### ####[]
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .#### #### ####[]
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .#### #### ####[]
Once for dinner and once for brunch .#### #### ####[]
I highly recommend it .#### #### ####[]
Highly recommended .#### #### ####[]
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .#### #### ####[]
I go twice a month !#### #### ####[]
I 'll keep this short .#### #### ####[]
Starters : Kobe Beef Sashimi .#### #### ####[]
It is terrific , as is the value .#### #### ####[]
I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .#### #### ####[]
BUT not in a good way .#### #### ####[]
We went to Ino for Valentines .#### #### ####[]
Just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .#### #### ####[]
Impressed ...#### #### ####[]
I love it .#### #### ####[]
Be aware .#### #### ####[]
MMmmm ... it was delicious .#### #### ####[]
On the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .#### #### ####[]
The price very reasonable .#### #### ####[]
A guaranteeed delight !#### #### ####[]
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well .#### #### ####[]
I 've had better chicken at BBQs ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .#### #### ####[]
Drinks : 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $ 35 each .#### #### ####[]
They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .#### #### ####[]
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .#### #### ####[]
i would just ask for no oil next time .#### #### ####[]
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .#### #### ####[]
If you 're into being lost when you 're just five feet from your table then hey , that 's a good thing .#### #### ####[]
This place was reccomended to me by a friend .#### #### ####[]
Got a date ? Go here !#### #### ####[]
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !#### #### ####[]
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .#### #### ####[]
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?#### #### ####[]
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !#### #### ####[]
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
I loved it and would go again .#### #### ####[]
Yes , it is good , but I 've had better for cheaper .#### #### ####[]
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .#### #### ####[]
Even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in New York pizza restaurants ) .#### #### ####[]
We got most of it back at home with us .#### #### ####[]
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !#### #### ####[]
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .#### #### ####[]
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .#### #### ####[]
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .#### #### ####[]
We had a very nice time .#### #### ####[]
I 've been here twice now .#### #### ####[]
Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .#### #### ####[]
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .#### #### ####[]
My husband and I take out from here 3-4 times a month .#### #### ####[]
Went there for an office lunch .#### #### ####[]
less wait time for me !#### #### ####[]
A little noise but I think that was because of our party !#### #### ####[]
What more could you want ?#### #### ####[]
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .#### #### ####[]
None was made so i hung up .#### #### ####[]
You will not be disapointed at all .#### #### ####[]
The only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time .#### #### ####[]
I was n't here for the pizza so I ca n't comment on that yet but what I had was very good .#### #### ####[]
supercilious scorn is in .#### #### ####[]
Try it !#### #### ####[]
I 'm a friendly person , so I would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .#### #### ####[]
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .#### #### ####[]
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best .#### #### ####[]
At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .#### #### ####[]
And it was quick which is very important .#### #### ####[]
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .#### #### ####[]
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .#### #### ####[]
wont come back again for sure !#### #### ####[]
The best !#### #### ####[]
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .#### #### ####[]
I recommend it !#### #### ####[]
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .#### #### ####[]
I 've never ordered anything else from their menu ... there 's no need to .#### #### ####[]
Trust me .#### #### ####[]
I have been living in NYC for bit now and I have to say I love to go out and explore the scene .#### #### ####[]
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe .#### #### ####[]
Will absolutely visit again .#### #### ####[]
10#### #### ####[]
Loved it#### #### ####[]
I would go back .#### #### ####[]
When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .#### #### ####[]
My GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it .#### #### ####[]
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .#### #### ####[]
It is expensive but well worth the money .#### #### ####[]
We did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .#### #### ####[]
It hits the spot every time#### #### ####[]
the bestt !#### #### ####[]
