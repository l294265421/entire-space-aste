Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [6, 8], 'POS'), ([12, 13], [16, 17], 'POS')]
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'POS')]
I really liked this place .#### #### ####[([4], [2], 'POS')]
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .#### #### ####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([7], [10], 'POS'), ([15], [20], 'NEU')]
But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .#### #### ####[([11], [14], 'NEG')]

You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [8, 11], 'POS'), ([14, 16], [-1], '-')]
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .#### #### ####[([23], [26], 'NEG')]
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [2], 'POS')]
The service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'POS'), ([1], [6], 'POS'), ([11, 12], [8, 9], 'POS'), ([25], [19, 20], 'NEG')]

I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .#### #### ####[([13], [-1], '-'), ([16], [-1], '-')]
The lox is always fresh too .#### #### ####[([1], [4], 'POS')]
I will go back to Suan soon !#### #### ####[([5], [-1], '-')]
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .#### #### ####[([22], [-1], '-')]
The wine list is also really nice .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [6], 'POS')]
How is this palce still open ?#### #### ####[([3], [-1], '-')]
This is a fun restaurant to go to .#### #### ####[([4], [3], 'POS')]
I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow .#### #### ####[([8], [7], 'POS')]
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .#### #### ####[([25], [23, 24], 'NEG')]
I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name .#### #### ####[([12], [-1], '-')]
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .#### #### ####[([1], [3, 5], 'POS'), ([10], [9], 'POS')]
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .#### #### ####[([1, 4], [7], 'POS')]
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .#### #### ####[([6], [5], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [23], 'POS'), ([35], [34], 'POS'), ([38], [37], 'POS')]
Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .#### #### ####[([0], [3], 'POS')]
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .#### #### ####[([10], [9], 'NEG')]

Pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [2], 'POS')]
Service was also very good .#### #### ####[([0], [4], 'POS')]
Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor .#### #### ####[([0], [2], 'NEG'), ([5], [-1], '-')]

For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [1], 'POS')]
But the staff was so horrible to us .#### #### ####[([2], [5], 'NEG')]
Always good drinks and service is pretty good ;#### #### ####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([4], [7], 'POS')]
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .#### #### ####[([1], [2, 5], 'NEU')]
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .#### #### ####[([6], [5], 'POS'), ([10], [9], 'POS')]
I have n't been to the other locations .#### #### ####[]
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .#### #### ####[]
I will be back !#### #### ####[]
Loved It#### #### ####[]
Good luck getting a table .#### #### ####[]
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .#### #### ####[]
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street , of course .#### #### ####[]
I 'm telling you ...#### #### ####[]
Eat at your own risk .#### #### ####[]
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .#### #### ####[]
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard#### #### ####[]
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .#### #### ####[]
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .#### #### ####[]
I 'm going back .#### #### ####[]
Very cozy and warm inside ... ..#### #### ####[]
How do you rate home ?#### #### ####[]
Without the wait or attitude , I would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .#### #### ####[]
Never got an explanation as to what was going on .#### #### ####[]
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .#### #### ####[]
Unhygienic#### #### ####[]
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .#### #### ####[]
We had a good time .#### #### ####[]
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .#### #### ####[]
We had fun eating in there , we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning !#### #### ####[]
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .#### #### ####[]
I would highly recommend .#### #### ####[]
Rather than eating the meat entree being offered , I requested a vegetarian dish .#### #### ####[]
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .#### #### ####[]
They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) .#### #### ####[]
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .#### #### ####[]
Frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .#### #### ####[]
If only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !#### #### ####[]
Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory .#### #### ####[]
Go hungry and enjoy .#### #### ####[]
For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc ... .#### #### ####[]
SO GOOD#### #### ####[]
You ca n't go wrong here .#### #### ####[]
More Williamsburg Garbage#### #### ####[]
Murray wo n't do it .#### #### ####[]
I went there after hearing how great it was .#### #### ####[]
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...#### #### ####[]
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?#### #### ####[]
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .#### #### ####[]
Will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .#### #### ####[]
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit .#### #### ####[]
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .#### #### ####[]
its alright#### #### ####[]
On that scale , it 's a world-beater .#### #### ####[]
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .#### #### ####[]
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .#### #### ####[]
Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater .#### #### ####[]
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .#### #### ####[]
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .#### #### ####[]
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .#### #### ####[]
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .#### #### ####[]
Definitely a neighborhood favorite .#### #### ####[]
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .#### #### ####[]
I had a great experience .#### #### ####[]
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier '' No apology , nothing .#### #### ####[]
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .#### #### ####[]
For those of you who do n't know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . )#### #### ####[]
Hey , I think $ 2+ for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .#### #### ####[]
During our trip to NYC , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pre-theater menu ( offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp ) .#### #### ####[]
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )#### #### ####[]
I was wrong .#### #### ####[]
The level of rudeness was preposterous .#### #### ####[]
What 's the difference between the two ?#### #### ####[]
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .#### #### ####[]
I will definetly be going back .#### #### ####[]
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .#### #### ####[]
Ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .#### #### ####[]
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .#### #### ####[]
One of my favorite places in Manhattan .#### #### ####[]
They charge different prices all the time .#### #### ####[]
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .#### #### ####[]
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars !#### #### ####[]
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .#### #### ####[]
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .#### #### ####[]
As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .#### #### ####[]
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .#### #### ####[]
We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .#### #### ####[]
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .#### #### ####[]
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i 'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .#### #### ####[]
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !#### #### ####[]
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .#### #### ####[]
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .#### #### ####[]
Definately check it out ! ! !#### #### ####[]
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here .#### #### ####[]
Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .#### #### ####[]
I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary .#### #### ####[]
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !#### #### ####[]
Small , bright , and clean , BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in Astoria and out .#### #### ####[]
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .#### #### ####[]
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G . again last night .#### #### ####[]
We all felt it was worth it .#### #### ####[]
Delicious , creative and fun .#### #### ####[]
Always busy but fast moving .#### #### ####[]
this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend .#### #### ####[]
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice .#### #### ####[]
Our friends have not arrived yet .#### #### ####[]
$ 500 included :#### #### ####[]
Such a disappointment ...#### #### ####[]
All in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Run do n't walk .#### #### ####[]
And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !#### #### ####[]
A real dissapointment .#### #### ####[]
Ca n't wait to go back .#### #### ####[]
I pray it stays open forever .#### #### ####[]
Just not good at all .#### #### ####[]
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .#### #### ####[]
so delicious ! ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .#### #### ####[]
We were then shooed inside .#### #### ####[]
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu .#### #### ####[]
but overall i give it a 10#### #### ####[]
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .#### #### ####[]
No thanks ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Still we keep going back : )#### #### ####[]
The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also .#### #### ####[]
it 's delicious !#### #### ####[]
Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .#### #### ####[]
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .#### #### ####[]
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .#### #### ####[]
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .#### #### ####[]
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .#### #### ####[]
After we ate our appetizers ( which took all of 8 minutes ) we ordered another round of Brahma 's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .#### #### ####[]
Come on .#### #### ####[]
Love it .#### #### ####[]
We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .#### #### ####[]
( i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood.. )#### #### ####[]
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .#### #### ####[]
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30 .#### #### ####[]
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .#### #### ####[]
Terrible would be a compliment !#### #### ####[]
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience ! )#### #### ####[]
I 'll be back for sure .#### #### ####[]
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !#### #### ####[]
Quite simply it 's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .#### #### ####[]
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .#### #### ####[]
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .#### #### ####[]
This restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !#### #### ####[]
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !#### #### ####[]
And amazingly cheap .#### #### ####[]
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn .#### #### ####[]
You 'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .#### #### ####[]
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .#### #### ####[]
Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening .#### #### ####[]
Wretched and retching#### #### ####[]
I came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since .#### #### ####[]
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .#### #### ####[]
It was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-I 've had better for less elsewhere !#### #### ####[]
The flavors robust and subtle .#### #### ####[]
